D01036	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism against Labelling organisations as terror organisations and labelling individuals as terrorists are quite different. If a person is named as a terrorist, he/she will face social exclusion and will be devoid of livelihood opportunities even if he/she proved otherwise. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone 67% of the cases ended in acquittal, which means they are probably innocent.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

D01051	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country against At present, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure the security of data. On the other hand, developed countries already have an efficient infrastructure. So, rushing toward data localization may not be a wise step. Because without efficient infrastructure, the data is prone to cyber-attacks. And the risk is severe here because it is financial data. But as the laws are made, it is a big challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

D01058	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country against The US is against data localization laws. Recently at the G20 summit, Donald Trump, the president of the US spoke against data localization. Its stance is natural because it increases the operational costs of US companies. India-US bilateral relations are important for both countries because we are intertwined in the export and import of IT services, professionals and goods, etc. So, imposing data localization laws without threatening Indo-US relations is another challenge.

D01114	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme against  It has been seen that it is difficult to retain employees in lean times when they are on variable pay schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when business is good, but they do poorly when business is bad. In times of slow business, even top salespeople might have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent living. If the market is slow and commissioned workers can’t earn enough, they may look for other employment opportunities. In lean times, fixed wages can be more effective at keeping employees from leaving for other opportunities.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix.

E04143	There should be no illegal migration. against What does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate.

E05018	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.  against Retirement is often funded by taxes and taxes are decided by each member state.

E05026	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability against The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force.

E05036	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU. against No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget. And until the democratic deficit and other systemic problems in the EU are fixed, it's good that the budget is kept at 1-2% of the total EU GDP.

E05039	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU against First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union.

E05046	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU against How would the candidates be selected? One per country?

E05048	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU against In Germany, the President of the Executive is not elected by the people directly either. The reason for this is the horrible experience during the Third Reich.

E05059	The President of the European Commission should be directly elected by direct universal suffrage against A direct election of a European president is a travesty of democracy.

E05066	Voting for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory against High voter turnout is usually desirable, but it's a symptom, not the root cause.

E05073	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU against No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person.

E05074	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU against The European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else. An elected head of the Commission would make nonsense of the principle of independence that is vital to the trust in the Commission's job.

E05098	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat against Horrible idea. Next, you will limit water or air?! This is not the way to move on climate change.

E05127	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat against I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced.   When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.

E05146	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat against I think forcing people to eat a limited amount of meat is totally the wrong way because of the following reasons:  1.

I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.

Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick.

If you insist on a set of shared EU principles and values that go beyond a mere symbolic declaration, these principles and values must include our real heritage: the Judeo-Christian values that have made Europe great.

E07116	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government. against We certainly need levels of government at the global, regional, and local levels.

E07129	The EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe. against Europe has more than enough ideological disputes within its own borders. We must settle those first - by falling back on a previous, more classical liberal position that was uncontroversial for most of our citizens.

E07134	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  against What are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world?

E07142	We need Integrated migration and border policy. against Migration has totally gotten out of control. The EU refuses to see the magnitude of it. Hundreds of millions like to migrate.

E07166	There should be centers of excellence in science and education against There has to be better funding for research, but it should not be administered top-down. Let researchers decide rather than politicians. Do not stifle research by bureaucracy.

E07210	Europe should stand together! against Do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately.

E07248	 The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world against Democracy and civilization are the essences of Europe and the EU must uphold those values.
