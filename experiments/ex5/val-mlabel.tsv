Due to increased demand, aided by increased supply (due to the setting up of factories) entrepreneurial activity got a boost. Businesses were set up, jobs increased, wages improved and living standards improved. Overall, the world took a turn for the better. This made everyone look at consumerism (or for them, vanity) in a different light. Instead of being a stigma, it actually became a boon.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

So, the change is voluntary. The change was mainly due to the improving education among women. So, the solution lies in encouraging education for girls, conducting awareness programs on the importance of education, financial independence and the consequences of teenage pregnancies should be conducted instead of passing a law to bring a real change in society.

As per the National Family Health Survey (2019-2021), 1/4th of the women aged 20-24 years were married before attaining the age of 18 years. After the pandemic, the number of child marriages increased significantly. So, the problem lies in the implementation. Hence the law alone cannot bring a change in society without proper implementation. Root causes should be addressed before bringing a law.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

E02106	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU against Europeans must embrace true values that enhance life and standards of living.  Anything related to drugs, in whatever form, degenerates humanity.

E02116	We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology against Capitalism and the free market indeed created western wealth. However, the interesting question then is: who benefited from this wealth?

E03019	We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports against It will take years before the local farmers will be able to give well paid jobs to the local workers.

E03026	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants against IQ tests do not prevent ill-intentioned people from entering our borders. Canada aims to receive 400,000 people each year, and how intelligent or skilled they are does not matter.

E03060	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal against If you want to do it for nuclear power, then it would be better to do it for every single kind of energy production methods. It’s also important then to include the complete cycle of all the energies, the human cost, the extraction of primary resources, in the case of renewable energy, take into account the necessary energy storage, and so on and so forth.

E03080	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants against This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist  authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.

E03081	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants against IQ is not an effective measure of whether they'll be economically beneficial, suited to European jobs  in high demand, likely to integrate/assimilate, their potential to cause crime etc.	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

E04086	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  against Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted.

E04087	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  against Halting all immigration to EU from non-European or non-first-world countries will lead to an even more competitive advantage for the USA and other countries as our population is shrinking rapidly.

E04104	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  against Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go!

E05011	We should increase the salaries of artisans against I think that people should grow, learn and move into better-paid jobs. Today there are fantastic opportunities, e.g. Artificial General Intelligence is being built, and human anti-aging and even rejuvenation therapies are being developed: these are only a few areas where the most pressing need of humanity is being met. People should move into such jobs. For the manual work - there are robots coming. We should not try to distort market forces and stop development.

E05111	We should stop daylight saving time change against Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.

E05112	We should stop daylight saving time change against Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.

E06029	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters against I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E06053	We should limit population growth in overcrowded regions against Limiting freedom of movement does not seem like a good idea to me.

E06060	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI against I think Europol should stay an association of regular National Police Departments and not be turned into anything else. However, I do support the creation of a European Criminal Investigations Office that will have full jurisdiction in the EU to investigate kidnappings and missing persons, cross-border and organized crime, terrorism threats, and digital crimes, and apprehend fugitives and suspects.

E06070	We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines against Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions.  Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe.  The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable! 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E06083	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters against National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success.

E07008	We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage against This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.

E07011	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants against All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified.

E07015	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants against Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people.

E07256	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality against I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.
