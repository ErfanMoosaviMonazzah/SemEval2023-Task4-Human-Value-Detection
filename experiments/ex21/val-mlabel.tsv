D01046	The third agricultural revolution, which is also called as ‘Green revolution resulted in the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Chemical-based farming results in soil health deterioration, heavy water usage for crops, and high input costs. Organic farming was started as a solution to this.

Reports say that almost 2000 nuclear weapons are kept on high alert throughout the year. Any misunderstanding or miscommunication can lead to a disaster, and with the impulsive leadership we are seeing around the world possibilities are higher than before.

E01081	Worldwide, nuclear power has prevented emissions of 240 billion tonnes of CO2 and prevented 1.8 million lives due to prevented air pollution (Kharecha, Hansen 2013).  therefore We should promote the use of nuclear energy	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
E01082	Nuclear power is safe - there are over 400 nuclear power plants globally, most of which have operated with no issues for the last 40 years, providing 24/7 electricity and preventing pollution and CO2 emissions. In terms of safety, including all accidents and pollution, nuclear power has caused 0.07 deaths/TWh, which is 40x less than natural gas and comparable with wind power (OurWorldInData 2021).  therefore We should promote the use of nuclear energy	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

E01092	There are whole regions that are completely energy-autonomous with wind energy, solar power & biogas - not only in developing countries but in industrialized countries as well. It's not a question of technology, but just of mindset & innovative arrangement. nevertheless Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E01093	Where energy costs for consumers are high in combination with renewables, it's mostly due to political decisions and market set-up, not due to technical issues. Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers. nevertheless Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

E01104	Including young people in decision-making processes considering climate change could potentially help to address the gap between the widespread official rhetoric claiming a great interest in involving young people in discussion and policymaking when it comes to climate protection and politics in general and the reality that falls too often too short of these declarations. therefore We should include young people in decision-making processes considering climate change	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
E01105	We are still living in a capitalism, so, the price will decide and the price of nuclear energy is the only energy price which is increasing steadily, while renewables become cheaper every year. Nuclear was always only subsidiesed by governments and never really standing on their own. The building process is slow, the price is high, no way, this could be a gain - if it weren't for the military.  nevertheless We should promote the use of nuclear energy	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

E01109	The EU has “beautiful” ideas and is working on legislation for animal welfare and the environment. But as long as EU subsidies still support mass animal farms, all of this is not credible! therefore We should stop subsidizing mass livestock farms	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

E02104	Tax should be compulsory, not voluntary!  Yes, the EU needs to collect direct taxes! For example, taxes on companies, and green taxes (tax on non-recycled items, tax on carbon, etc), as all should be harmonized across the EU. therefore We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

E02108	Nations that have adopted living wages for full-time jobs have highly profited from that step. It's been an economic booster because if people who earn & possess little can afford what they need, they will buy. So they increase demand. Demand increases supply. More supply means more jobs, more suppliers, lower costs, etc.  therefore We should make living wages a human right	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E02109	Pushbacks may not be a nice way of operating. However, Brussels is causing problems by telling the whole World that everyone (7 billion people) has the right to apply for asylum in the EU.  It would be much better by refusing admission to anyone appearing at the border without papers.  The experience is that over 80% of the immigrants are not refugees in danger. therefore We should make pushbacks legal 	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

E02116	Capitalism and the free market indeed created western wealth. However, the interesting question then is: who benefited from this wealth? Without some sort of regulation and control from the State, companies will continue what they do best, increase profit without any concern for environmental and social matters.  nevertheless We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
E02117	Islam represents the biggest threat to democracy in the EU since it’s not compatible with European values. Islam, it’s not only a religion but almost a constitution which trying to impose on European society.  therefore We should stop hosting migrants from Muslim countries	[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E02118	EU leaders continue their naive policy of hosting millions of migrants from Muslim countries without taking into consideration the inability to integrate into society even after many generations,  and the fact that the Muslim diaspora is controlled by their countries of origin, the most flagrant example is the interference of Turkey and its dictator Erdogan in the German elections calling the Turkish diaspora to boycott this election since none of the candidates please him.  therefore We should stop hosting migrants from Muslim countries	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

E03014	Obviously, this is the future: less suffering animals, more plants, less CO2, more healthier people.... and don't forget the artificial meat as an alternative or first step. therefore We should promote a plant-based diet	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E03015	Sounds a little xenophobic. There is no concept of indigenous or aborigenous population in Europe, the only criteria is citizenship. nevertheless We should not forget about indigenous Europeans	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
E03016	Are IQ test really worth anything? Stick to teaching the language and basic values, the rest will follow. nevertheless We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E03017	Wood should be used as building material & other meaningful products only. Anything else is a waste of resources. No fresh wood for paper, fast furniture  therefore We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E03018	Please consider this: right now in Africa several million people are half starved, and eat a meal a day at best. They live thanks to cheap agricultural products coming from Europe, because local stuff is too expensive for them. nevertheless We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E03019	It will take years before the local farmers will be able to give well paid jobs to the local workers. In the meantime you'll have a famine and a genocide. And I didn't even mention the effects of a sudden huge inflation wave. nevertheless We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E03020	According to BBC: 'Bitcoin uses more electricity annually than the whole of Argentina' therefore We should prohibit certain energy-intensive cryptocurrencies	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

Rational environmentalism can save both our planet and our democracy (from the menace of the radical Greens). therefore We should improve and modernize our energy infrastructure	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
E03026	IQ tests do not prevent ill-intentioned people from entering our borders. Canada aims to receive 400,000 people each year, and how intelligent or skilled they are does not matter. People working in the agricultural fields are being naturalized, relatives are being naturalized. nevertheless We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E03027	Not all combustion engines use petrol as a fuel - natural gas engines are way more environment-friendly nevertheless We should prohibit internal combustion engines	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

E03031	The real problem, even with the war refugees is that once they enter the EU they do not want to return to their countries, even if the danger has passed. They even bring their family and other relatives! therefore We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E03033	This is a huge discrimination.  Everyone should have the chance to develop to a personal level. Or should we all do an IQ-test to stay in our country? Because it could avoid dangerous things like rasicm.  nevertheless We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
E03037	To create value directly in the rural areas, is very important. therefore We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E03038	Making compost out of organic waste and distribute it to gardeners and farmers will help to create value and a better environment. therefore We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E03041	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. They are internationally recognized & very precise. As far as I know, all or most countries have agreed on these goals. The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details. therefore We should make zero/low waste products more affordable	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
E03042	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product. therefore We should make zero/low waste products more affordable	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

E03047	I don't see how stopping putting a stop to migration will suddenly impact our eco footprint in that extend. Firstly, migration is in our nature. Without migration you wouldn't be here.  second, the cost of migration is self-sustained. nevertheless We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

E03049	Instead we should look into investing in foreign countries and help building a stable environment. nevertheless We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E03050	I absolutely agree that solar power plants should not be deployed on fertile, arable land & wood should not be cut down to make place for this endeavor. This needs to be regulated swiftly! therefore We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
E03057	Things that are supposed to serve us for a long time, like a vehicle or telecommunication device or household implements should be designed to last half a lifetime under normal use. The quality of the building material should matter more in that instance, so less focus on recycling. therefore We should not produce unnecessary garbage	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
E03058	Things that are one-time use only, like most packaging and the like, should be radically focused on recycling potential. therefore We should not produce unnecessary garbage	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E03059	People from several countries are asking for asylum in Europe in hope of better life conditions. Those people aren’t guilty for being born in those countries and EU should support everyone. nevertheless We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
E03060	If you want to do it for nuclear power, then it would be better to do it for every single kind of energy production methods. It’s also important then to include the complete cycle of all the energies, the human cost, the extraction of primary resources, in the case of renewable energy, take into account the necessary energy storage, and so on and so forth. nevertheless We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E03061	Extremely important thing for an informed decision of the citizens e.g. in the supermarket. therefore We should label products with environmental impact and climate impacts in clear language	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
E03065	Changes in management practices, and above all the integration of trees in arable and pastoral lands, are key, and could turn agriculture from a net emitter to a net absorber of greenhouse gases. therefore We should support agroforestry	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E03068	Agrivoltaic could be a perfect model for an energy cooperation of citizens to own some greenhouses with photovoltaic & rent them for a small fee to a urban gardening cooperation of citizens, for example.  therefore We should invest in integrated photovoltaic (e.g., over agriculturally used land)	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E03069	I agree! So perhaps we will have less meat but also less pollution, and much more quality of meat, of air and of environment therefore We should put a higher tax or a toll on imported meat from abroad.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E03070	If we tried to fix the issue by controlling the population, countries like Denmark would need to reduce their population to 1/5 of the current number, to reach sustainable resource use. nevertheless We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E03071	Instead we need to change our behavior, reduce our consumerism and decrease our overall resource use per person. nevertheless We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E03072	Instead we need to reduce inequality in between countries and distribute wealth more evenly around the world. nevertheless We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
E03073	The environmental impact of a given product should also be stated on its package and/or in menus in order to raise awareness on the subject. therefore We should promote a plant-based diet	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E03074	In addition to this, schools and companies canteens should be required to serve mainly plant-based meals in order to reduce their impact and to educate their users. therefore We should promote a plant-based diet	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
E03076	European Union has already forgotten for example about the Ingrian Finnish indigenous nation. We have our own unique flag, our own unique language (that only about 1300 people speak in the entire world), our own land that the Ingrian Finnish lived on before Russia took over Karelia and sent them all to labor work in Siberia, Karelian forests and Estonia. therefore We should not forget about indigenous Europeans	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
E03079	Stopping immigration as an excuse to not adopt proper anticonsumerist and industry-regulating policies will not solve anything for the environment and will only increase interethnic and interracial tensions. nevertheless We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E03080	This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist  authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.    nevertheless We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
E03081	IQ is not an effective measure of whether they'll be economically beneficial, suited to European jobs  in high demand, likely to integrate/assimilate, their potential to cause crime etc. nevertheless We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
E03082	This just seems like an overtly emotional suggestion that isn't too well thought out. It would cause far more problems that it solves. nevertheless We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E03088	Fish are sentient and failure to afford them the same legal protections that we provide other animals is a gross moral and legal oversight. therefore We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
E03089	We should encourage people to consider the question: 'Do you think it is morally right to torture, mutilate, and kill animals needlessly?' therefore We should reduce animal farming.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
E03090	We can work together to encourage plant based diets and make the world a better place. therefore We should reduce animal farming.	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
E04012	Many countries have the view that unauthorized asylum seekers should be removed. therefore We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

E04016	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out. nevertheless We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing. 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E04026	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop the conflict. therefore We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E04027	 Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop immigration. therefore We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E04030	We can only employ people in understaffed job fields. therefore We should not have illegal immigrants!	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
E04031	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely. therefore We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

E04036	Illegal loopholes in the legislation are enabling illegal migration. Family Reunification has been and remains the biggest channel of migration into the EU. therefore We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E04037	The procedure of Family Reunification is already causing major problems in the USA.  therefore We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E04038	Family Reunification creates unbearable levels of migration and acute problems of integration for several EU Member States. therefore We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E04041	The European Commission’sportrays migration as an opportunity only, a Fatality that cannot be stopped, and the only solution against aging. therefore We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E04042	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological. therefore We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E04047	Organizing, promoting, directing and financing mass migration is a crime against humanity. therefore We should stop mass migration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

E04052	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us. therefore We should restrict immigration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E04075	Only together and with  Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years. therefore We should protect the European border	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

E04086	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.   nevertheless We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

E04088	Japan was a global superpower once just behind the USA, however, it has a strict immigration policy. Where is it now in global power rankings? nevertheless We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
E04098	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.  therefore We should protect the European border	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E04104	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work!  What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights nevertheless We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
E04118	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims. therefore We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E04129	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically. therefore We should punish illegal immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E04133	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex).  therefore We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E04134	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic. therefore We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E04137	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'. therefore We should stop integration.	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
E04152	Frontex is a key agency and is called to play a crucial role in the coming years. Yet, it lacks the necessary political support it deserves to carry out its mission.  therefore We should support Frontex.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E04153	 The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate. therefore We should support Frontex.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E04156	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa.  Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans. therefore We should stop immigration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E04158	The organization of mass migration is a heinous crime. No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries. therefore We should stop immigration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E04160	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border. therefore We should protect the European border.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E05011	I think that people should grow, learn and move into better-paid jobs. Today there are fantastic opportunities, e.g. Artificial General Intelligence is being built, and human anti-aging and even rejuvenation therapies are being developed: these are only a few areas where the most pressing need of humanity is being met. People should move into such jobs. For the manual work - there are robots coming. We should not try to distort market forces and stop development. nevertheless We should increase the salaries of artisans	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E05014	The convenience of carrying fewer coins is obvious. therefore We should stop making one-cent coins	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E05015	A one-cent coin costs about 60% more to produce than it is actually worth.  therefore We should stop making one-cent coins	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E05021	The use and promotion of civic technology contribute to a more inclusive, resident-focused urban co-governance model and build ecosystems rich in creativity and innovation, thanks to the diversity of users and perspectives that are at stake. therefore We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
E05022	These platforms are an opportunity to encourage the creation of public value and new forms of citizen participation, especially in urban areas.  therefore We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E05023	In an era of weakening of political parties and distrust of the electorate for them, the future of democracy depends on the re-evaluation of the role of institutions and the direct involvement of citizens to investigate and understand the problems.  therefore We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E05024	Civic technologies can support the co-creation, co-production, and co-management of public services with citizens and the development of the urban commoning approach. therefore We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
E05032	The European Parliament is in dire need of reform. It has become a circus, where the MEPs engage in wild ideological posturing without substance. The EP's function is to address the pressing needs of EU citizens, but it hasn't done that for ages. One possible solution could be to replace it with a legislative body that is made up of delegates from member state parliaments. therefore We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E05033	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution. It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament.  therefore We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E05096	The bicycle should be the main mode of transport for a majority of citizens because it is faster, it is easier, it is healthier, it is cheaper, it is more convenient, and it is eco-friendly. therefore We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E05097	Having cycling and micromobility as primary modes also makes cities quieter, less congested, less polluted, safer, and simply more pleasant and liveable, particularly for children. therefore We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities	[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E05104	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals. It would be good for every person to be given psychotherapeutic advice once a year in order to be able to diagnose and treat mental disorders and illnesses at an early stage or even to prevent them. therefore We should promote mental health	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E05105	A psychological examination should be part of child screening, together with counseling to parents (e.g. dealing with children’s own concerns and fears, or increasing self-confidence among children and parents). It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognize them in the home and learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health.  therefore We should promote mental health	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E05106	Subsidies for meat production and fishery not only have a negative impact on our environment - but they also destroy the economy in poorer countries in Africa! We really should find a way to stop these and get out of this vicious circle! therefore We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
E05111	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border. nevertheless We should stop daylight saving time change	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E05112	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future. nevertheless We should stop daylight saving time change	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E05136	 All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs. therefore We should stop daylight saving time change	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E05141	If the European Council listened to the results of the inquiry made by the European Commission. 'The EU was set to stop changing its clocks in 2021, but then came Brexit, the pandemic, and some messy international bureaucracy'. therefore We should stop daylight saving time change	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E05142	A reflection on the future of Europe needs to identify and involve other actors alongside local and international institutions to fully deploy the founding values of our continent in addressing major global challenges.  therefore We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
E05143	Through their emphasis on wisdom, social cohesion, and interrelatedness Faith-Based Organizations can show the potential to not only effectively mobilize people on the ground in responding to climate change but more importantly to motivate large sections of society to move from their deep seeded set of core values. therefore We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
E05155	It is purely economic in nature and encourages excessive production and consumption. therefore We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E06009	The more language communication skills around the closer we can get in this complicated world we live in. The fact it is a popular language around the world but not really recognized in Europe should change. I fully endorse its recognition in Europe. therefore We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E06010	Esperanto is a common language of citizens from all countries of the EU. Esperanto encounters bring them together for contact and understanding. The authorities of the European Union are called upon to support this direct communication of the citizens. It is our free choice in which language we want to talk to each other - please recognize and promote it!   therefore We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
E06012	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values. They bring crime, terror, and chaos. And after all, if there are no more Europeans in Europe, then what will happen to our beloved continent? therefore We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E06016	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime! therefore We should legalize non-violent drug use	[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E06029	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty. nevertheless We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E06030	I fully agree that people should not be incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses. Drug addiction should be treated as a health issue. Drug addicts need help. Incarceration does not help them. therefore We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E06031	We should legalize drugs as a means to promote justice, harm reduction, and religious freedom.  If we really want justice and human rights, this is absolutely essential. therefore We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
E06032	It's also important to remember that many people use these psychedelic medicines in the context of their own religious/spiritual practice, and therefore our draconic laws directly violate freedom of religion (and sovereignty over our own bodies). There's no way the EU should tolerate this if they really care about human rights. therefore We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
E06033	Psychedelic medicines specifically have the potential to radically transform our mental health care.  therefore We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
E06038	Excessive surveillance preemptively assumes everyone is a potential criminal and definitely undermines the basic human right of autonomy and self-determination.  therefore We should prevent the surveillance state	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E06039	The number of video surveillance and control and intervention rights for public authorities is steadily increasing (at least according to my subjective feeling). This puts our free way of life at risk. A person who feels monitored will never really act freely.  therefore We should prevent the surveillance state	[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E06040	I am not prepared to continue to restrict my freedom on a permanent basis due to the actions of a minority of offenders, as a citizen who is not a victim. The policy has to find a better balance here.  therefore We should prevent the surveillance state	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E06046	In order to be able to fight cross-border crime, Europol should have the same jurisdiction as the FBI in the US. It should focus on domestic EU cross-border crime fighting. It should have the autonomy to act without the intervention of local or national political influence. therefore We should reform Europol towards a European FBI	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E06047	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto. therefore We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
E06048	Illegal mass migration is a tragedy. Those who organize and direct mass migration are guilty of a crime against Humanity. Soros and Lukashenka are prime examples of such criminals.  therefore We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E06049	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues. therefore We should legalize non-violent drug use	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E06053	Limiting freedom of movement does not seem like a good idea to me. I think what you are experiencing is bad local management, with urban planning laws fast growth and traffic issues can be fixed and avoided altogether. nevertheless We should limit population growth in overcrowded regions	[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E06054	European institutions should take factual studies of the relative harm of different drugs into account. A UK study has shown that drugs such as cannabis and many hallucinogenic drugs are far less harmful than alcohol. The study in question was conducted by David J Nutt, Leslie A King, Lawrence D Phillips, on behalf of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs therefore We should legalize non-violent drug use	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E06060	I think Europol should stay an association of regular National Police Departments and not be turned into anything else. However, I do support the creation of a European Criminal Investigations Office that will have full jurisdiction in the EU to investigate kidnappings and missing persons, cross-border and organized crime, terrorism threats, and digital crimes, and apprehend fugitives and suspects.  nevertheless We should reform Europol towards a European FBI	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E06067	The traditional family is the cornerstone of European civilization.  therefore We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E06068	The family is people's foundation and it rests on it all their lives and work, and this needs to be valued. therefore We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E06070	Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions.  Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe.  The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable!  nevertheless We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E06083	National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success. We need to be united, aligned, and, above all, independent from any extra-EU hegemon! nevertheless We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07007	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there. therefore We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07008	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically. nevertheless We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07010	Refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course. When it comes to crimes, people are simply no longer worthy of protection and cannot be expelled because their actions show us that they neither accept nor respect our rules. therefore We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07011	All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified. Refugees/migrants are not to be expelled, certainly not immediately, but to be included in the employment problems and economic situation. nevertheless We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants	[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07012	Protecting the EU's external borders and guaranteeing that no one can enter the Schengen free movement zone who does not have the right to do so is a primary condition for security in Budapest, Berlin, Lyon, or anywhere in Europe. therefore We should protect the EU borders and stop migration	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07013	Before Frontex is strengthened, Frontex's human rights violations must first be stopped. nevertheless We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E07015	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people.  If we manage to be a welcoming continent, the people who come will thank us by being part of society. nevertheless We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07023	EU must take action. Help those in need, but only those who respect legal boundaries. Mutual respect is a cornerstone in this subject where we must set limits to protect Europe.  therefore We should remove illegal immigrants.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07026	Only together and with  Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years. therefore We should protect the European border	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07028	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.   nevertheless We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
E07029	Halting all immigration to EU from non-European or non-first-world countries will lead to an even more competitive advantage for the USA and other countries as our population is shrinking rapidly.   nevertheless We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07030	Japan was a global superpower once just behind the USA, however, it has a strict immigration policy. Where is it now in global power rankings? nevertheless We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
E07031	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border. therefore We should protect the European border.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07066	Frontex is a key agency and is called to play a crucial role in the coming years. Yet, it lacks the necessary political support it deserves to carry out its mission.  therefore We should support Frontex.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07067	 The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate. therefore We should support Frontex.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07072	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims. therefore We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E07088	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex).  therefore We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07089	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic. therefore We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
E07093	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'. therefore We should stop integration.	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E07104	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically. therefore We should punish illegal immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07112	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years.  therefore We should protect the European border	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07115	The organization of mass migration is a heinous crime. No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries. therefore We should stop immigration.	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07117	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa.  Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans. therefore We should stop immigration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07124	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work!  What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights nevertheless We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07144	I am concerned about the source of some cotton, which is produced in Chinese detention camps. A unified EU mark of ethical & environmental principles would be a nice thing to have when deciding what to buy. therefore We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
E07164	Unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants have no right to be in the country where they are unauthorized. therefore We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07165	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out. nevertheless We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing. 	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07168	The vast majority of the victims of this genocide in China are Muslims. And yet, the Muslim countries see the USA and the West as their arch-enemies!  therefore We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07186	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop the conflict. therefore We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07187	 Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop immigration. therefore We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07188	Organizing, promoting, directing and financing mass migration is a crime against humanity. therefore We should stop mass migration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07201	We can only employ people in understaffed job fields. therefore We should not have illegal immigrants!	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07202	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely. therefore We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E07203	 Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop! therefore We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E07212	Illegal loopholes in the legislation are enabling illegal migration. Family Reunification has been and remains the biggest channel of migration into the EU. therefore We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07213	The procedure of Family Reunification is already causing major problems in the USA.  therefore We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07214	Family Reunification creates unbearable levels of migration and acute problems of integration for several EU Member States. therefore We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07220	Many countries have the view that unauthorized asylum seekers should be removed. therefore We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E07221	The European Commission’sportrays migration as an opportunity only, a Fatality that cannot be stopped, and the only solution against aging. therefore We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07222	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological. therefore We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07231	No more immigration from non-European or non-first world countries. therefore We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07234	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people. therefore We should restrict immigration.	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07235	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us. therefore We should restrict immigration.	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E07256	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament.  nevertheless We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E08006	A good idea to end online trolls and haters. Easy to set up, it is a very good short-term solution, but fake news, unfortunately, escapes this regulation. So there is a need for other measures to attack the algorithms of the social networks themselves. therefore We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E08007	Anonymity is at least as much as important as Identity.  Today it is very easy to be anonymous, but hard to prove the identity of opinion and establish a public web of trust.  Anonymity enables powerful identities to control the messages, and therefore the identity-seeking masses.  therefore We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users	[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E08010	Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are by far the most important neighbors of the EU. A good relationship with all three is very desirable for the EU. For that, we would have to be willing to understand their history better. therefore We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
E08011	The Russian Federation is our neighbor. We share common historic and cultural ties with them. Today the EU confronts Russia with sanctions. An understandable reaction to its actions in Ukraine and failing democracy. Let us not forget actions done by others (US intervention in Iraq, the Chinese in Tibet and their treatment of minorities, etc.). Yet we close our eyes. therefore We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E08012	Russia is troublesome with its own agenda and unconventional methods. Perhaps due to a heritage of a system, that is no longer the norm today. Remember, they fought next to us and Russians merit our hand reaching out to them. A policy change to show empathy, foster closer economic ties, and build on bilateral projects and partnerships in various cultural, scientific, trade, or economic programs.  therefore We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
E08013	Including Russia in our sphere of friendship would allow the EU to discuss certain values from within and coax them toward democracy and change. Economic partnerships can act as leverage. Friendly ties, in time, will bring common views to prevail.  therefore We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
E08014	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.). therefore We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E08021	The Russians use the money we give them in exchange for gas to spread disinformation, and propaganda and finance the terrorists in the Donbas and its mercenaries (Wagner Group) in Libya.  therefore We should stop buying Russian gas	[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E08022	The cost of gas will be higher. But I prefer to pay a little more for the gas bill than to finance Putin’s malicious activities. therefore We should stop buying Russian gas	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E08024	We must support countries that want to improve the welfare and rights of their citizens. If a country wants to join the EU and meets the conditions for joining, the decision to join is solely between the candidate country and the EU. therefore We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
E08025	When you see young Ukrainians dying for the EU and its values during Euromaidan, you have no choice but to accept that Ukraine has chosen Europe. If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. We must deepen our relations with Ukraine and prepare to make it a candidate for membership. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia. therefore We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
