G01001	That victory required national cohesion, voluntary sacrifice for the common good and trust in institutions and each other. America’s response to Covid-19 suggests that we no longer have sufficient quantities of any of those things. therefore Could today’s version of America have been able to win World War II? It hardly seems possible.
G01002	This week my Times colleague Apoorva Mandavilli reported that experts now believe that America will not achieve herd immunity anytime soon. therefore Instead of being largely beaten, this disease could linger, as a more manageable threat, for generations.
G01003	A major reason is that about 30 percent of the U.S. population is reluctant to get vaccinated. therefore This week my Times colleague Apoorva Mandavilli reported that experts now believe that America will not achieve herd immunity anytime soon.
G01004	Researchers and reporters who talk to the vaccine-hesitant find that the levels of distrust, suspicion and alienation that have marred politics are now thwarting the vaccination process. They find people who doubt the competence of the medical establishment or any establishment, who assume as a matter of course that their fellow countrymen are out to con, deceive and harm them. therefore That basic sense of peoplehood, of belonging to a common enterprise with a shared destiny, is exactly what’s lacking today.
G01005	Why should I take a risk on an experimental vaccine? therefore This “the only person you can trust is yourself” mentality has a tendency to cause people to conceive of themselves as individuals and not as citizens.
G01006	I’m not especially vulnerable. I may have already gotten the virus. If I get it in the future it won’t be that bad. therefore Why should I take a risk on an experimental vaccine?
G01007	Trust levels in any society tend to be reasonably accurate representations of how trustworthy that society has been. therefore Most of the time distrust is earned distrust.
G01008	If you distrust the people around you because you think they have bad values or are out to hurt you, then you are going to be slow to reach out to solve common problems. Your problems will have a tendency to get worse, which seems to justify and then magnify your distrust. therefore The other thing to say is that once it is established, distrust tends to accelerate.
G01009	although the number of people who receive a dose each day is down from its peak. nevertheless Vaccination is going relatively well in this country,
G01010	But right now, this moment feels to many like the beginning of the end of the pandemic. nevertheless Things could always get bad again, and the C.D.C. could always update its guidance and reintroduce more aggressive restrictions.
G01011	Still, even after the virus is brought under control it is still likely to have lingering effects. nevertheless But right now, this moment feels to many like the beginning of the end of the pandemic.
G01012	because more than 30 million Americans have already been infected with the virus. therefore This is quite significant
G01013	Neither of us wants to be the alarmist in the relationship, not when we are young and healthy and so far removed from harm’s way. therefore “No. It’s not so dangerous for us.”
G01014	Grocery stores are stocked, we are getting everything delivered without any issues, the hospitals are not crowded. therefore Besides, Shanghai is in good shape.
G01015	to put an ocean between us and this sprawling epidemic. therefore Our family and friends are all worried about us, urging us to return to the United States while we still can,
G01016	We have a couple of boxes of masks, jugs of drinking water, potatoes and cabbages, instant noodles, cereal and a couple of frozen steaks. therefore Even if the situation in Shanghai becomes less comfortable, we are not helpless.
G01017	especially since I have very little trust in the Chinese government, given its track record. therefore When I really think about it, it makes no sense for me to be so laid back about this virulent new disease,
G01018	Yesterday, I saw on social media that someone noticed that the ratio in the official figures for the total dead to the total diagnosed cases has remained exactly 2.1 percent every day since Jan. 30. therefore I managed to convince myself for a while that everything would be fine, but it was only a matter of time before something came along to shatter this illusion.
G01019	Graphs of the coronavirus curves in Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy look like mountains, with steep climbs up and then back down. The one for America shows a fast climb up to a plateau. For a while, the number of new cases in the U.S. was at least slowly declining. Now, according to The Times, it’s up a terrifying 22 percent over the last 14 days. therefore No other developed country is doing so badly
G01020	At the federal level as well as in many states, we’re seeing a combination of the blustering contempt for science that marks the conservative approach to climate change and the high tolerance for carnage that makes American gun culture unique. therefore Republican political dysfunction has made a coherent campaign to fight the pandemic impossible.
G01021	At the beginning of the crisis Trump acted as if he could wish the coronavirus away, and after an interval when he at least pretended to take it seriously, his administration has resumed a posture of blithe denial. therefore The rot starts at the top.
G01022	Now, as New York gingerly reopens, Arizona has become a hot spot — which isn’t stopping Trump from holding a rally at a Phoenix megachurch on Tuesday. Cases are also soaring in Texas, Florida and several other states. therefore An epidemic that was once concentrated in blue states is increasingly raging in red ones.
G01023	New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, not only forced nursing homes to take back residents who’d been hospitalized for the coronavirus, he barred them from testing the residents to see if they were still infected. therefore When coronavirus cases started exploding on the East Coast in March, there were devastating failures by Democratic leaders.
G01024	Still, by the time New York’s cases got to where Arizona’s are now, he at least understood that the state faced calamity and imposed the lockdown that helped bring it back from the abyss. nevertheless Given how Cuomo’s errors contributed to New York’s catastrophe, it’s hard to say how much credit he deserves for eventually rising to the occasion.
G01025	Across the country, public health workers have faced death threats, harassment and armed protesters at their homes. therefore The paranoia and resentment that have long been part of the culture of the modern right are now directed at those warning about the ongoing dangers of the pandemic.
G01026	your health; the prevalence of cases where you live; the safety precautions being taken any place you want to visit. But the final answer may depend on your individual risk tolerance for exposure to infectious disease. therefore There are many knowable parameters in the equation:
G01027	In a world of effective antibiotics and antivirals and other treatments, deaths or even serious illnesses from infectious disease seem nearly incomprehensible. therefore So our fear is enormous, and our risk tolerance for exposure is just about zero.
G01028	Even if one of the current vaccine candidates works, it could be quite a while before it’s widely distributed. And to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it has to protect only half of the people who take it from infection. therefore I hear too many people saying “I’m not going back to life until there’s a vaccine” — as if that will immediately eliminate the risk. It won’t.
G01029	For the foreseeable future we will be living in a world with some level of coronavirus out there. therefore So if we want to get out of our bunkers, we all need to take stock of our risk tolerance.
G01030	Risk tolerance is about duty and conscience but very often it’s also about how much you need a paycheck. therefore Some, of course, never got to make this decision.
G01031	Now many physicians I know in Covid-19 hot spots say they actually feel safest in the hospital, where procedures like masking and sanitizing are assiduously followed. (Hell hath no fury like a surgeon who witnesses a medical student touch a sterile surface with an unsterile hand.) In contrast, on the sidewalk, the coronavirus could be roaming free if people aren’t wearing masks. therefore Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced.
G01032	It’s not just about your individual risk tolerance, but about keeping everyone safe therefore Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced.
G01033	But once schools have put in place appropriate science-based steps, most teachers (those not in high-risk groups) should return to their jobs. nevertheless I do not blame teachers for being unwilling to return to school in places where administrators and local officials have been in denial about Covid-19 or have been unwilling or unable to do this preparatory work.
G01034	As someone who suffers from pretty significant anxiety about my health therefore I am, in theory, the last person who should ever do any medical trial at all, and, on the way up to the hospital, this thought occurred to me numerous times.
G01035	I texted one of my friends, an extremely smart, Ivy League-educated doctor. He responded with reservations about taking the vaccine at such an early stage. He said he himself wouldn’t. He was not the first person to express this sentiment. Many people around me told me I was nuts for doing this. They look at me in bewilderment. These people weren’t anti-vaxxers; they don’t belong to dubious Facebook groups. They are educated, often left-leaning — people who shouldn’t, theoretically, have vaccine hesitancy. therefore Smart people are worried about this vaccine.
G01036	Only 21 percent of Americans surveyed in a CBS poll this month said they would get the vaccine as soon as possible if one was offered at no cost. therefore As President Trump pushes for the quick rollout, public trust is eroding.
G01037	Three in four Democrats say if a vaccine were to become available this year, their first thought would be that it was rushed without enough testing, CBS reported. therefore It’s not hard to see where this is heading: a nightmare in which we have a vaccine yet mistrust of the government is so great that people won’t take it.
G01038	Normal will come back a lot faster therefore if Americans take the chance and stick their arms out for science. Ask not what your country can do for you but what vaccine trial you can enroll in.
G01039	Alongside growing controversy over judicial nominations, court reform and Covid-19 policies, American law is in the midst of a little-noticed paradigm shift in courts’ treatment of public health measures. The Republican Party’s campaign to take over the federal and state courts is quietly upending a long and deeply embedded tradition of upholding vital public health regulations. therefore A catastrophic sequence of decisions has blocked states from responding to the pandemic.
G01040	In state and federal courts alike, Republican-appointed and Republican-elected judges are upsetting the long-established consensus. therefore Today, however, the tradition of salus populi is in collapse.
G01041	Next month, the court is scheduled to hear arguments on a startling and widely criticized decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas last year that offers yet another opportunity to strike down the Affordable Care Act. therefore The health care of millions could be cast into question even as the pandemic rages.
G01042	In the past, when epidemics have threatened white Americans and those with political clout, courts found ways to uphold broad state powers. therefore All of this is a sharp departure from a long history of judicial solicitude toward state powers during epidemics.
G01043	Normally, vaccines aren’t licensed until they show they can protect for a year or two. therefore “It’s a reasonable bet, but still a gamble that protection for two or three months is similar to six months or a year,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the Food and Drug Administration panel that is likely to review the vaccine for approval in December.
G01044	To date, no serious side effects have been revealed, and most tend to occur within six weeks of a vaccination. nevertheless scientists will have to keep an eye out for rare effects such as immune enhancement, a severe illness brought on by a virus’s interaction with immune particles in some vaccinated persons, said Dr. Walt Orenstein, a professor of medicine at Emory University and former director of the immunization program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
G01045	Those vaccines contain immune-stimulating particles like the ones contained in the Shingrix vaccine, which is highly effective in protecting older people against shingles disease. therefore It’s possible that vaccines under development by Novavax and Sanofi, which are likely to begin late-phase clinical trials later this year, may be better for the elderly, Dr. Offit noted.
G01046	The Pfizer vaccine, unlike others in late-stage testing, must be kept supercooled, on dry ice around 100 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, from the time it is produced until a few days before it is injected. mRNA quickly self-destructs at higher temperatures. therefore Can it be rolled out effectively?
G01047	But if the F.D.A. approves it quickly, that could make it harder for manufacturers of other vaccines to carry out their studies. therefore Could a premature announcement hurt future vaccines?
G01048	If people are aware that an effective vaccine exists, they may decline to enter clinical trials, partly out of concern they could get a placebo and remain unprotected. therefore But if the F.D.A. approves it quickly, that could make it harder for manufacturers of other vaccines to carry out their studies.
G01049	Many vaccines will be needed in order to meet global demand for protection against Covid-19, therefore so it’s crucial to continue additional studies.
G01050	Scientists have never established correlates of immunity for pertussis, for example, although vaccines have been used against those bacteria for nearly a century. therefore But it’s difficult to build such road maps.
G01051	He said: “I hope this makes people realize that we’re not stuck in this situation forever. There’s hope coming, whether it’s this vaccine or another.” therefore Still, this is good news, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former F.D.A. deputy commissioner.
G01052	For weeks Americans have watched those who are well connected, wealthy or crafty “jump the line” to get a vaccine, while others are stuck, endlessly waiting on hold to get an appointment, watching sign-up websites crash or loitering outside clinics in the often-futile hope of getting a shot. therefore When hospital administrators and politicians’ spouses get immunized before people more at risk, it undermines confidence in the system.
G01053	That’s in part because, desperate to end their own pandemic nightmare, many of our most respected institutions and politicians have behaved badly. therefore To eliminate this knock-out-your-neighbor race to score a vaccine, the administration needs to find ways to build trust in the system. It will take more than “more people, more places, more supply” to end the Darwinian competition and restore confidence and order.
G01054	turning orthopedic wards into Covid intensive care units, canceling elective surgeries, bringing retired health care workers back to help, all the while losing thousands of staff members to the virus. therefore Of course hospitals have performed heroics during the pandemic —
G01055	But some also have behaved selfishly during the vaccine rollout. nevertheless Of course hospitals have performed heroics during the pandemic — turning orthopedic wards into Covid intensive care units, canceling elective surgeries, bringing retired health care workers back to help, all the while losing thousands of staff members to the virus.
G01056	But many hospitals interpreted the recommendation broadly, inoculating their entire staff — public relations departments, administrators, programmers, laboratory scientists and, sometimes, their boards. They offered vaccines to psychiatrists who were seeing their patients on Zoom. They vaccinated radiologists who were reading films at home. therefore But some also have behaved selfishly during the vaccine rollout.
G01057	Many older Americans who are not tech-savvy or lack internet access have been unable to get slots. It might be theoretically possible to sign up by phone, but by the time you get through, the newly released appointments may be gone. Those without a child or grandchild to help secure an appointment could be out of luck. therefore Pity the rule-followers:
G01058	after all, hospitals would just offer the unused vaccine to the next person on the list. therefore I don’t blame the lucky recipients;
G01059	But the United States has allowed its public health system to become a hollowed-out underfunded mess, and many vaccination clinics are being run and staffed by contracted private companies. And the private sector has so far proved too vulnerable to private favoritism. nevertheless Now, the new administration is coordinating with states to set up more mass vaccination sites. That’s great.
G01060	The disease revealed and amplified social tensions that had festered under the surface and brought back whispers of civil war. The people could stand no more, and even the fainthearted Senate at last showed hopeful signs of courage. therefore The era of the Antonine Plague offers a reminder of what a powerful force nature has been throughout human history.
G01061	But there is a serious side to these parallels, too: nevertheless it can seem a bit uncouth to tap into our training to treat Rome as a mirror of our own times.
G01062	The way we understand the past inevitably shapes how we understand the present. therefore But there is a serious side to these parallels, too:
G01063	The way we understand the past inevitably shapes how we understand the present. therefore What we can learn from reflecting on this chapter of ancient Rome is not so much an example to follow or neatly packaged solutions for our own crises, but a different sensibility, an awareness of what a powerful force nature has been throughout human history.
G01064	We inevitably bring our own anxieties and sensibilities to the study of the past. therefore The result is that even the most turned-over pages still tell us things we had not expected.
G01065	Our relationship with the environment reverberates back upon us, sometimes with destructive force. therefore A second lesson is that human health and animal health are inseparable.
G01066	For instance, Covid-19 has made the psychological import of daily death tolls in our ancient texts — such as the 2,000 per day that died in Rome under Commodus — far more real and vivid than ever before. therefore Living through a pandemic not only causes us to see different layers of the past, but can also inspire us to listen to our ancient sources more empathetically.
G01067	Rome was struck at its apex of power and prosperity — precisely because that power and prosperity had made it ecologically more likely that such a microbiological challenge would emerge and disseminate. therefore One of the hardest paradoxes to reckon with, though, is that the Antonine Plague was as much a symptom of the empire’s success as its sins or stresses.
G01068	Even with all the tools of modern biological science, we could not have predicted exactly when and where a new pandemic would emerge. therefore A sense of our fragility should not make us fatalistic. Rather, it should inspire us to be less complacent.
G01069	But we were warned, and those warnings went unheeded, in part because we told stories about ourselves implying that we had been freed from nature, that we were immune from the patterns of the past. nevertheless Even with all the tools of modern biological science, we could not have predicted exactly when and where a new pandemic would emerge.
G01070	The Antonine Plague wasn’t the last lethal pandemic the Romans faced. And Covid-19 won’t be ours. therefore It is a lesson we would do well to heed.
G01071	Until coronavirus vaccines are distributed equitably and nations agree to immunization standards, therefore vaccination passes will not end the spread of Covid-19.
G01072	International law allows countries to require visitors to prove they have been vaccinated against diseases like yellow fever. But coronavirus vaccines are new, and they haven’t all been authorized for use throughout the world. therefore Mandating vaccine passports for international travel introduces several challenges.
G01073	Without international consensus, we risk entrenching geopolitical divides with inconsistent requirements that could prolong the pandemic. Vaccine passports that enable citizens of some nations to travel internationally while millions of others wait for vaccinations will serve only to deepen global inequities. therefore These systems must also prevent countries from arbitrarily refusing to accept certificates.
G01074	First, the vaccine rollout in the United States has been plagued by inequities: Black and Latino people are being vaccinated at much lower rates than white people. Second, not everyone can get vaccinated: The shots haven’t been approved for children, and the data on the safety of vaccinations during pregnancy is limited. Vaccination passes will need a mechanism to ensure that people who can’t get the shots aren’t denied jobs, services or education. therefore And an American plan would present a number of issues.
G01075	Businesses that require vaccinations for customers or employees will need systems for reviewing vaccine passports, which could create a significant financial burden for struggling businesses. While schools and health care providers have long required and tracked certain immunizations, many companies have never needed to contend with vaccine requirements. If vaccine passports come in the form of a smartphone app, some people won’t be able to use them. And, of course, since a vaccine passport records private health data, a failure to protect this information would create large risk of fraud, counterfeiting, discrimination and privacy violations. therefore A requirement by employers and businesses of proof of vaccination would carry not only ethical and legal hurdles, but also logistical challenges surrounding how that data is collected, stored, verified and protected.
G01076	But millions of American adults, not to mention children, still need to be injected to keep themselves and their communities safe. And it’s likely some of them aren’t doing so in part because they fear or just don’t like needles. nevertheless Of all the barriers to Covid-19 vaccination, fear of needles may seem trivial to overcome.
G01077	because a body of research shows that around one in 10 adults are so afraid of needles that they will delay or avoid vaccinations. therefore This is a substantial public health problem,
G01078	Some people might avoid getting vaccinated altogether, and others might endure it under immense distress, putting them at risk for what experts call immunization stress-related responses such as feeling dizzy or fainting during an injection. therefore High levels of needle fear, with or without a diagnosis, can affect vaccination programs.
G01079	Strategies like organizing one-way clinic flow with privacy options help avoid long lines and having people being injected “on display” for others waiting. And it doesn’t start and end at the vaccination site — people working to promote vaccines should keep needle fears in mind and consider positive and neutral images that don’t show the needles themselves. therefore Organizers of vaccination programs have important roles to play in setting up their vaccination sites to minimize needle fears and immunization stress-related responses.
G01080	People at the high end of the needle fear spectrum will most likely need another approach to manage that fear first rather than get a vaccination while extremely frightened. therefore Exposure-based therapy is recommended.
