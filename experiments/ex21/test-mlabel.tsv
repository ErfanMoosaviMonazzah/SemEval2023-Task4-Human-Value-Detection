D01020	This may set as a bad example for the succeeding governments. Downgrading the status of a state to union territory can be taken as a precedent.

This game is a sign of the presence of colonialism. nevertheless Cricket should be declared the national game of India
D01089	Crony capitalists are able to get away with just about anything. They enjoy the full support of money and the government in all their endeavors. Their decisions may even cause the economy to suffer adversely. therefore We should fight crony capitalism in India
D01090	Crony capitalists get an advantage over their competitors due to support from the government. Simple examples of the undue advantage they get may be in the form of easier loan sanctions, loan approvals despite adverse credit ratings, easier land acquisition, out-of-turn property registration, tender approvals without any past record of performance, etc. This ruins the reward system of the markets. A monopoly gets established in the markets which prevents new players from entering the markets. This leads to lesser entrepreneurial activity in the country. Decreased entrepreneurial activity leads to lesser job opportunities and borrowing. therefore We should fight crony capitalism in India
D01091	Crony capitalism has led to India having the world’s worst non-performing loan ratio. Lenders gave away loans to unworthy entities over the years despite knowing their credit backgrounds.

The banks are left with no other option but to take huge haircuts (sometimes even as high as 65%) on the loans recovered. Taxpayers' money is often used to bail out these banks in order to save the economy. therefore We should fight crony capitalism in India
D01092	An atmosphere of decreased lending is created and, in turn, the economy gets slowed down. As can be seen in India, entrepreneurial activity is extremely low. Job opportunities are extremely low today. India is experiencing the highest levels of unemployment in the last 4 decades. The Indian economy has been posting 7%+ GDP repeatedly but yet the common people are suffering while the rich are getting richer. therefore We should fight crony capitalism in India

D01118	In India, it is very difficult for women to go to police stations to report crimes against them. Men’s commission may further deter them from approaching courts. nevertheless There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
D01119	If a woman is a victim of any sort of harassment and is in a distress, society will more likely to help her. But the same is not true for men. If a man is a victim of domestic violence or sexual harassment, there is no single government entity he can approach to. Moreover, society may make fun of him for being weak. This is the reason married men are twice likely to commit suicide when compared to married women. To address these gender stereotypes and discrimination, there is a need for 'National commission for Men'. therefore There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
D01120	As per the 2011 census, India has a 51.47% male population. India has a 'Ministry for women & child development', but none of the government entities is working on men’s rights. As India is a democratic country, it is unfair to neglect people based on their gender. therefore There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
D01121	With better and more stringent mechanisms and laws in place to deal with sexual harassment, rape cases, and domestic violence cases, unfortunately, there have been instances of misuse of the laws to cause harm to innocent men. Setting up a Ministry of Men would at least give such men a chance to make their case. This, in no way, is meant to undermine the case for the protection of women. therefore There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
D01122	It has been observed that in countries where the sex ratio is skewed against women, crimes against women increase drastically. As can be easily seen in India, crimes against women have been on the rise. Most horrific of all, crimes against minor girls have increased drastically since 2012. This paints a very grim picture of our society as a whole. The highest GDP growth rate amounts to nothing if our society itself is corrupted to the extent that it is right now. India has been a patriarchal society for centuries. To make a shift to an egalitarian society for women in every aspect of life, Indian men need to be re-educated and rehabilitated with the new norms. therefore There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
D01123	Drug addiction is a menace that has plagued Indian youth in recent years. The majority of drug addicts are males. A ministry of men can help solve the problem of why capable male youth of the country are resorting to such self-destructive activities. therefore There is a need for 'National Commission for Men' or 'Ministry of Men' in India
D01129	The residents get to have a community of their own. They can interact, make friends and enjoy themselves together. therefore Retirement homes should become more common
D01130	Retirement homes are usually built in such a manner that injuries due to domestic accidents are minimized. Skid-proof tiles, arthritis-friendly fittings, etc are some of the features that they exhibit. therefore Retirement homes should become more common
D01131	The elders get to live a life of dignity. They do not feel like a burden on any of their relatives. They are also treated respectfully in their own community as compared to being ill-treated by their relatives. therefore Retirement homes should become more common
D01132	Medical facilities are readily available at retirement homes making it easier for the elderly in case of severe emergency or even the slightest discomfort. therefore Retirement homes should become more common
D01133	At well-maintained retirement homes, they get individual care for their condition, be it any kind of sickness, disability, or medical condition. Nurses, caretakers, etc make sure that they are comfortable. therefore Retirement homes should become more common
D01134	Any retirement home worth spending the rest of your life in is quite costly for a middle-class family. nevertheless Retirement homes should become more common
D01135	Senior living homes or retirement homes may sometimes feel secluded from the outer world. nevertheless Retirement homes should become more common
D01136	The residents may feel a lack of connectivity with their family members. Being away from the family for too long can sometimes be depressing for some people. nevertheless Retirement homes should become more common
D01137	What caregivers and nurses cannot substitute is the feeling of being loved by your family members. For them, it’s only a job and there is no connection at a personal level. nevertheless Retirement homes should become more common
D01138	The residents might be ill-treated by the authorities at the retirement homes. nevertheless Retirement homes should become more common
D01150	Though our constitution guarantees equal rights to women in all aspects, the mentality of people didn’t change. There have been several cases of rapes, domestic violence, dowry, acid attacks, etc. that led to the formation of several strict laws for women's safety. In 2011, India was ranked as the fourth most dangerous country for women in the world (in 2018 India was ranked the most dangerous country for women) and worst among the G20 nations when it comes to women's security. therefore We should deal with gender inequality
D01151	Women are lagging far behind men in education. Fewer girls attend school as compared to boys and also their dropout rate is high. According to the 2011 census, the data literacy rate of women is 65.46% as compared to 82.14% of men. This difference is alarming. therefore We should deal with gender inequality
D01152	Though the government and courts are trying to bring equality to society, it has to be the people’s mindset that needs a change. And in big and developed cities of India, this positive change is quite visible but in villages and small towns, there is a lot of gender inequality to be dealt with. therefore We should deal with gender inequality
D01153	As per Article 370, people of other regions cannot buy land or settle in Jammu & Kashmir. This is acting against the development of the region. By abolishing article 370, teachers, doctors, and other professionals can settle there bringing better facilities. And also industries can be set up in the region and hence Jammu & Kashmir can be economically developed. therefore We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir
D01154	By abolishing this article, the government can act tough against the terrorism present in the region. therefore We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir
D01155	Many laws such as The prohibition of the Child Marriage Act, and women’s reservations were not applicable to Jammu & Kashmir, because of the provisions of Article 370. All laws of India should also be applicable to J&K. therefore We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir
D02001	People of J&K have a feeling that settlers from other regions will change the demography of the region. So, due to the abolition of article 370, they may protest against the central government. therefore We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir
D02002	Citizens of Jammu & Kashmir are facing so much struggle because of many reasons such as the fight between India and Pakistan, the constant presence of troops, the unemployment crisis, etc. So if the special status is also removed, they may feel like their voice is suppressed. therefore We should remove Article 370 which grants special status to the state of Jammu & Kashmir
D02003	Urbanization results in increased population density, which leads to pressure on resources such as land, water, medical professionals, and police. therefore We should fight against urbanization
D02004	As more people keep coming to urban areas, there will be more supply of human resources than demand, hence the wages will decrease. Hence many people work so hard for a meager income. therefore We should fight against urbanization
D02005	More population causes a burden on the government and hence it will be difficult to ensure the quality of life for all. therefore We should fight against urbanization
D02006	Due to high demand, land prices, housing prices, and rents will increase drastically. Not everyone can afford the prices. Those who can afford to have to spend a large part of their income on housing. The people who cannot afford to rent in urban areas are forced to live in slums with substandard housing and poor sanitation facilities, which negatively affects the health of people living there. therefore We should fight against urbanization
D02007	Cooked food may get wasted in case of the wrong estimation of hungry people in the area. nevertheless We need a national policy to set up community kitchens throughout the country
D02008	India ranked 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index, 2021. Many people in India are undernourished and are sleeping on an empty stomach. As the supreme court mentioned, it is the duty of the welfare state to ensure that all the citizens have food to eat. By establishing community kitchens throughout the country, we can ensure that everyone has access to nutritious food. therefore We need a national policy to set up community kitchens throughout the country
D02009	Due to the pandemic, many people lost jobs, especially those who are working in the informal sector. So, now community kitchens are more needed than ever. therefore We need a national policy to set up community kitchens throughout the country
D02010	Tonnes of food grains rot every year at the Food Corporation of India (FCI). By supplying the food grains to the community kitchen, the waste of food grains can be prevented, and instead that can be used to feed hungry people.  therefore We need a national policy to set up community kitchens throughout the country
D02011	Many people, especially youngsters are willing to volunteer. But not many have access to volunteer options nearby. Once community kitchens are set up, many people will happily volunteer and will donate supplies too. therefore We need a national policy to set up community kitchens throughout the country
D02012	Implementation of community kitchens requires continuous efforts from the government. Many such initiatives from the government are neglected after a few months. nevertheless We need a national policy to set up community kitchens throughout the country
D02043	Initially, India faced issues such as vaccine shortage, lack of availability of vaccines in remote places, etc. But now after solving all these challenges, the main challenge now is to vaccinate those who do not want to be vaccinated. So, by enforcing legal measures such as compulsory vaccination, we can achieve 100% vaccination. The government can help them in dealing with their fears by keeping them for a longer time in vaccination centers while having a medical team by their side. therefore COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
D02044	If the world did not achieve 100% vaccination, a lot of new variants will be created. So, it is important to vaccinate all to reduce the possibility of new strains. therefore COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
D02045	Many people are not taking vaccination due to the rumors that are being spread by anti-vaxxers using social media. Taking action against these rumor creators is much better for improving the vaccination rate rather than enforcing compulsory vaccination. nevertheless COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
D02046	Widespread awareness campaigns involving local people can help in overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Innovative and creative advertisements can encourage people to take the vaccination. These methods will be much more effective than legal measures. nevertheless COVID-19 vaccination should be made mandatory
D02059	In the hope of becoming rich, many people are burning money to buy overhyped digital art. Many will lose money when people lose interest in buying these NFTs. Some people are saying that NFTs are a bubble that is going to burst. therefore We should ban NFTs
D02060	NFTs help artists sell their paintings, music, etc. for a good amount of money, which may not be possible before NFTs. nevertheless We should ban NFTs
D02061	Whenever an NFT was sold or bought, the transaction consumes lots of electricity. This huge energy consumption is a serious issue because we are already fighting against climate change. therefore We should ban NFTs
D02062	Hackers are stealing NFTs. And they are also stealing cryptocurrencies by sending malicious NFTs. Recently, hackers stole $150k worth of crypto from Twitch co-founder’s Fractal NFT project. therefore We should ban NFTs
D03002	Drones are being used in many industries. They go to places where it is difficult for humans to go. For example, they can be used to deliver medicines quickly in hilly regions. Drones can be used to deliver food in times of natural calamities. Not just delivering food, using drones, rescue teams can find people that are stuck and can save them. So, drones can save lives. nevertheless We should ban the use of drones
D03003	Drones can be misused to stalk, vandalize homes, and for doing many other anti-social activities. There have been many incidents, where drones posed security threats. therefore We should ban the use of drones
D03004	Earlier, there was a threat of coercion and booth capturing. Some people used to threaten voters to vote for a particular candidate. Using CCTV cameras prevented this to a large extent. But now, e-voting has the same vulnerability. It is difficult to provide security to everyone in their homes. therefore E-voting brings more harm than good
D03005	It is prone to hacking. Even when we are using advanced technologies to make it more secure, hackers are also using new technologies and new methods to hack. It may also raise privacy issues. Even though blockchain guarantees anonymity, there is a possibility of a hack to know who voted for whom. Hackers may even hack smartphones to know the details. therefore E-voting brings more harm than good
D03006	Still, the digital divide exists in not just India but in the entire world. So, this may create new inequalities where some people can cast their vote from home and some others have to visit a polling station. therefore E-voting brings more harm than good
D03016	Children are made to work in industries with hazardous chemicals, and machines under harsh weather conditions, resulting in physical casualties and many severe diseases.  therefore India needs to address the issue of child labor
D03017	Due to a lack of education and proper guidance, they get influenced by criminals and take shortcuts to become rich, and end up committing crimes at a tender age. The rates of juvenile crime cases are increasing day by day in India. therefore India needs to address the issue of child labor
D03018	The number of harassment and child abuse cases has drastically increased in the last few years most of them are sexual abuse cases occurring with girls and boys aged below 15. therefore India needs to address the issue of child labor
D03019	Childhood is the most important phase for the development of physical and emotional abilities. The problem of child labor is stealing childhood from many children. Mere making laws to prevent it doesn’t solve the problem. Implementation of the laws on a war footing is needed. therefore India needs to address the issue of child labor
D03025	There are other options available like ‘Hyperloop’, which is more feasible and less costly. India could have provided her scientific expertise and given land holding to the research and development of these technologies. nevertheless We should invest in the development of high-speed railways
D03026	The cost of the project is more than 1.5 lakh crore for a single rail line. Instead, this money can be invested in the development of the present railway system which is a case deserving more immediate attention, seeing the recent rail accidents in India.  nevertheless We should invest in the development of high-speed railways
D03027	Bullet trains will decrease travel time hence increasing connectivity as well as ease the means of transport, hence eliminating regional differences. Moreover, bullet trains could prove to be an important means of transportation for long-duration journeys for the middle-class population of the country. therefore We should invest in the development of high-speed railways
D03028	The question of economic feasibility is being raised as the project is too costly at Rs. 1.5 lakh crores. However, similar questions were raised during the introduction of telecom services and the commission of Maruti. As the service expanded and the demand increased, not only did the respective areas become profitable, but the prices also went down outrageously. therefore We should invest in the development of high-speed railways
D03029	High-Speed Railways (HSR) in India are going to be a new step toward a technologically advanced nation that would help in the development of infrastructure as well as reduce unemployment. therefore We should invest in the development of high-speed railways
E01010	There has to be a general awareness that the real price of throw-away products and mass-produced foods is paid in the long run and that continuing down the current path will lead to more problems than having to adjust one's consumer behavior.  therefore We should change our consumption habits
E01011	Not taking climate impact and biodiversity loss into account makes it difficult for businesses to move towards a more virtuous system.  therefore We should change corporate accounting rules to include climate change and biodiversity loss 
E01012	It is important to take into account all negative consequences in the balance sheet of companies so that everything that is taken/destroyed/polluted from nature is accounted for. therefore We should change corporate accounting rules to include climate change and biodiversity loss 
E01016	The idea of a circular economy could help us to tackle the problem of overconsumption and overproduction of waste.  therefore We should change our consumption habits
E01017	What does it mean to have a mere CO2eq. indicator? That's utter nonsense as there are many more impact categories. nevertheless We should have a CO2 Carbon Equivalent Indicator for every product in the market
E01041	e-coins can be easily blocked, erased, or stolen.  therefore We should ban cryptocurrencies
E01042	Cryptocurrencies are causing massive damage to the environment due to large energy consumption. therefore We should ban cryptocurrencies
E01043	all these alternations of Bitcoin are copies of the one Ponzi scheme - you pay for 'fiat' as these e-coins are backed only by the faith of e-believers willing to own it therefore We should ban cryptocurrencies
E01046	Microplastics are everywhere nowadays: in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. It is said that we consume a credit card's worth of plastics every week. This must stop before we consume an apple's worth of plastics every week.  therefore We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic
E01047	Not many consumers are aware of how many of their products contain microplastics because producers deliberately hide this fact by only referring to the chemical names of microplastics on labels.  therefore We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic
E01048	In order to in parallel raise consumer awareness about which products contain microplastics, the EU should introduce a requirement for mandatory labels on packages of products containing microplastics warning consumers of the presence thereof. therefore We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic
E01049	the solution must be a combination of EU regulation of microplastics, producers proactively replacing microplastics with natural elements with the same functions, and consumers making more informed choices to reduce demand from products with microplastics. therefore We should have mandatory labels on products about microplastic
E01057	the second EU starts banning cryptocurrencies, it will start getting compared to totalitarian regimes (even more than now). nevertheless We should ban cryptocurrencies
E01058	everyone should have a right to own cryptocurrency. nevertheless We should ban cryptocurrencies
E01062	such an approach to be successful must be implemented in each EU country to have visible results and help change the habits of both EU citizens and the private sector. And it has to be long-term promoted and funded. Can we do it? therefore We should change our consumption habits
E01063	Education is key. School curricula could help have more responsible consumption.  therefore We should change our consumption habits
E01064	The national governments with the help of the EU should be able to set up “taxes” or “rewards” as in Sweden or Denmark to encourage citizens to recycle. therefore We should change our consumption habits
E01066	giving nuclear energy a green label will encourage the flow of financial resources across the EU toward environmentally sustainable activities therefore We should give nuclear energy a green label
E01067	Nuclear energy can be considered sustainable because it is cheap and can be predicted for decades, and the price of power produced by nuclear power plants is not affected by changes in the price of natural gas or other energy carriers. therefore We should give nuclear energy a green label
E01068	Nuclear energy use helps to avoid the release of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants every year, which contribute to the development of acid rain, smog, lung cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. therefore We should give nuclear energy a green label
E01085	It is absolutely ridiculous to be spending money on these climate disastrous practices. The EU is nowhere close to keeping with the Paris Climate Agreement and is still funding unsustainable practices left and right. therefore We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
E01086	The agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, €58 billion. This vast amount is flowing into completely outdated agricultural subsidies that promote and support an economic model dating back to the 1960s, which produces vast amounts of CO2. It is not only the steel, coal, car, cement, and other industries that contribute to global warming, it is also agriculture that is not reformed and continues to operate under regulations that protect vested interests rather than really support building a sustainable model.  therefore We should eliminate the outdated agricultural subsidies
E01087	a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network will lower plane traffic therefore We should build a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network
E01088	a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network will create an affordable European travel card to make traveling by train possible for the majority of European citizens. therefore We should build a Europe-wide uniform high-speed train network
E01089	There is scientific consensus on the fact that fish have the ability to feel pain and emotions such as fear.  therefore We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
E01090	Fishing with live bait creates the risk of introducing and spreading invasive species, as well as the risk of transmitting diseases to wild fish.  therefore We should ban live-bait fishing within the EU
E01095	Garbage trading is typical of capitalism in private hands. Not only among exporters in the EU but also among the recipients distributed worldwide in third countries. therefore We should criminalize the export of waste
E01096	Waste produces negative environmental impacts in the recipient state.  therefore We should criminalize the export of waste
E01097	Exported trash is burning for months suffocating local people and wildlife. therefore We should criminalize the export of waste
E01098	Exported trash is often flushed to the sea by rain, thus polluting rivers on the go. therefore We should criminalize the export of waste
E01122	It's an empty slogan that doesn't reflect the core principles and true nature of European integration. Member States and their peoples are the basis.  nevertheless We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01123	The random radical constitutional foundation of the EU only riles hesitant populaces without solving a particular problem.  nevertheless We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01124	We need to realize the truth of what's out there. Truthful and open research without bias or stigmas. therefore We should create an EU protocol for UAP reports of personnel employed by airlines and personnel of all armed forces for all member states
E01125	I guess that after the recent Russian attack on Ukraine, the idea of the EU defense and the army seems much more feasible and convenient. therefore We should develop a strategy for the EU defense in relation to NATO
E01131	Less centralization in Brussels, more flexibility. therefore We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01133	This is the only way that European values and democracies can survive the challenges ahead of us. Europe has two kinds of countries: small countries and small countries that haven't realised they are small yet. If we want to protect European sovereignty we need to keep integrating. The other option is to sell our countries to China and Russia or turn them into American colonies.  therefore We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01134	There is little or no educational, conservational, research, or economic benefit derived from wild animals in traditional circuses that might justify their use and the loss of their ability to behave naturally as wild animals.  therefore We should ban animals in circuses
E01135	In circuses, wild animals in circuses are destined to a life of physical abuse and mental torture. therefore We should ban animals in circuses
E01136	The public can still attend numerous successful contemporary circuses that do not use wild animals and continue to enjoy the experience, of varied and exciting human acts. therefore We should ban animals in circuses
E01137	Circuses are traveling entertainment services moving around Europe, and performing wild animals are transported across Member States, where circuses pose a severe public safety threat. therefore We should ban animals in circuses
E01138	The broadcasting license on the European level can enable the creation of media champions that will be able to compete with media champions in other parts of the world (CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera...) therefore We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
E01139	The broadcasting license on the European level can project European soft power beyond its borders.  therefore We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
E01140	The broadcasting license on the European level can help avoid misinformation, meddling, and foreign influence more than smaller networks, which would ensure a better quality of the content. therefore We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
E01141	The broadcasting license on the European level will unite European markets for film and music.    therefore We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
E01144	I agree, it would agile bureaucracy and it would benefit both citizens and institutions. therefore We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
E01145	As we are sometimes required to move for work (mobility of workforce) it would be great, if all EU countries accept a language or format of official documents. therefore We should have personal documents (ID, Birth certificate, etc.) recognized in all EU countries
E01148	No Federations, no centralization. We need to respect the European diversity.  nevertheless We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01149	A federal republic in which all European peoples can live according to their own way of life and identity. Yes, that would help! therefore We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01150	We must recognize that in the face of climate change, a refugee crisis, a past financial crisis, and now a pandemic, it is no longer sufficiently well-welcomed to present the interests of Europeans therefore We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01151	The individual member states are too weak to cope with the major challenges of our time.  therefore We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01153	EU needs to take advantage of the high quality of high school education to enable the best young people to develop their talents for the benefit of society. therefore We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E01154	Research, and in particular open-ended curiosity-driven research, is the essential solid bedrock on which a better and more innovative Europe can be built. therefore We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E01155	Without increased financing of research, we will lack a firm evidence base. therefore We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E01156	Without increased financing of research, the industry will miss out on disruptive technologies. therefore We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E01157	Without increased financing of research, the movement toward better political, social and legal structures will falter. therefore We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E01158	If the EU intends to survive it has to integrate less.  Go back to the EEC. Instead of building a static bloc, it should increase competitiveness. nevertheless We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01160	Lately, the EU has appeared weak and non-organized. For example, we have had no joint policy on how to handle the pandemic. Actions to deal with various problems often come too late. You cannot discuss solutions for years, which requires urgent action.  therefore We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01161	Since the EU was developed, little progress and much stagnation have been made.   nevertheless We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01162	The EURO has been a disaster. It has impoverished the EU and turned the EU into a fighting Union.  nevertheless We should further develop the European integration process into a federation
E01164	Europe is slipping badly behind in many technological sectors. More investment by both the public and private sectors is needed to solve this problem. therefore We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E01165	Without decades of basic research to build on, the development of not one but several vaccines against Covid-19 to battle the current pandemic would have been impossible.  therefore We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E01166	Massive cuts to the research budget are leading to a tremendous brain drain and are destroying Europe as the home of scientific excellence.  therefore We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E01167	To face future crises – from climate change over cancer to multi-resistant bacteria - we need a strong fundament of open research that will provide the solutions when needed. therefore We should allocate 3% GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E01168	Feeding or dressing man is no longer an acceptable excuse with the state of knowledge of the “modern” world. therefore We should end animal abuse
E01169	A common broadcasting license would have an effect on the EU countries experiencing democratic backsliding therefore We should implement a common broadcasting license across the EU
E01170	No science means war, hunger, material, and moral poverty. therefore We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E02077	All of Europe has to pay income tax & VAT, except for the Eurocrats. In Belgium, you have to pay 50 % of your salary to the state, unless you work directly for the EU. Is this fair? No, of course not! It is time to make Europe fairer in a very practical and direct way, by abolishing tax exemptions for European politicians and staff.  therefore We should abolish tax exemption for EU politicians
E02078	NGOs are often America's way of interfering in European elections. NGOs must be policed more vigilantly to prevent America from interfering in our elections. therefore We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands
E02079	Migration is an ongoing phenomenon. Destroy what was built to face it wouldn't solve it.  We need to have a shared strategy for its management or it will continue without any control.  I'm not saying that policies should remain as they are or that we should accept everyone coming to Europe. I'm just saying that we must have a shared policy, in order to move in the same direction on this important topic. nevertheless We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 
E02080	We must do the exact opposite, otherwise, each country will take all immigrants and push them to the north. Spain, Italy, and Greece do not have the means to stop migrants at their borders. nevertheless We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 
E02081	With the ongoing population explosion, in particular in Africa and the ME, the EU has no other option than a total ban on immigration. Exceptions can be made for temporary stays and for experts the EU needs.  therefore We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 
E02082	The EU attempts to gain power over the EU members on the distribution of immigrants.  It thereby cuts the rights of the EU members.   therefore We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 
E02083	The EU is also weak in dealing with NGOs and in dealing with countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrants.  Indeed, the EU cannot be trusted because of a lack of ambition or lack of competence. therefore We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 
E02084	The NGOs are committing the EXACT same crime Lukashenko is guilty of: Organizing mass migration and directing it toward Europe is aggression and an act of hybrid warfare.  therefore We should ban NGO boats and take migration out of the EU's hands. 
E02085	Creating new funds will only benefit some banks.  nevertheless We should create a European Wealth Fund
E02086	Just another pile of debt with more bureau-crazy.  Forget it. nevertheless We should create a European Wealth Fund 
E02087	Creating a European Wealth Fund will help to foster European growth and unity. therefore We should create a European Wealth Fund 
E02088	A European Wealth Fund should be created to serve as the nexus for strategic investments in European and international economic activity aligning with European fundamental rights, norms, and values and the global green and digital transition. therefore We should create a European Wealth Fund 
E02089	We should focus more on human welfare. Currently, waste sorting and recycling are degrading human exploitation in sweatshops.  nevertheless We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects 
E02090	The market will not create those jobs, therefore it must be done by the public, at the European level as well as national, regional, and local levels. therefore We should create millions of jobs in the restoration of ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change projects 
E02091	The 2000-year-old European culture is rapidly disappearing.  Add the mass immigration of unskilled people to it and we have to conclude that the EU is on a kamikaze flight.  Young people have to be encouraged to start a family. For example by financial support for housing or paying off student loans. therefore We should end mass immigration and support Europeans in having the resources to have more children
E02092	No person should really earn an income from owning land itself, because it is not the result of human labor. Planet Earth is the common inheritance of humanity, why should any human have the right to take a piece of ground and demand payment from someone else for the privilege of using it? The land exists independently of the land owner. therefore We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
E02093	A land tax would eliminate land speculation because the increase in ground rent would go away in tax. therefore We should establish a 100% tax on the rent of land in Europe
E02094	Having all workers working in private enterprise, irrespective of size, share equity in the company they work for by default would motivate higher worker dedication, overall operating and productive efficiencies, improved quality, profit sharing, reduced corrupt practices in management through stricter accountability, work satisfaction - a win-win situation for all. therefore We should have all workers working in private enterprises share equity in the company they work for
E02119	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger. therefore We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E02120	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes! therefore We should ban wild animals in circuses
E03001	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger. therefore We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035
E03002	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes! therefore We should ban wild animals in circuses
E03021	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps? nevertheless We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
E03022	If Europe is going to have concentration camps again, they should be in Europe, in plain sight, for everyone to see. nevertheless We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
E03023	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries. nevertheless We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
E03024	Setting up inhumane camps by bribing local warlords is not the right way. nevertheless We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
E03034	In addition to production and shipping, the score should also reflect the impact of the product's disposal. For example if the product requires to apply many different (toxic) chemicals for recycling, this should result in a worse score.  therefore We should implement a climate score for products
E03035	Yes, but the problem is: Just because a product can be recycled, it does not mean that it always will be recycled. Let's assume that there would be a really climate friendly way to recycle batteries. Still people could throw those into landfills. How does the score deal with this? therefore We should implement a climate score for products
E03036	Where do you think should be stored nuclear/radioactive waste please? Stored in glaciers will be problem (with melting etc.). nevertheless We should build more nuclear power plants
E03043	Agree. If the asylum seekers don't have to cross the Mediterranean to apply for it less of them will die trying and less human trafficking will take place. therefore We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
E03044	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others. therefore We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
E03056	I think every region or city has the right to protect the citizens & the environment. If they all have to wait till the whole European Union is following & all existing cars which have been produced & sold under different conditions naturally fade out, they have no chance.  nevertheless We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering
E03062	I highly support this. As Jonathan Foer puts it in his book 'We are the weather': Changing our diet will not suffice to save the planet, but we won't save it unless we eat differently. therefore We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
E03075	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. It is only transitional. We have good conditions for sustainable green energy (solar, wind, hydro, bio-methane and their combinations). nevertheless We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy
E03083	I understand your point and its importance, but as long as I have fangs in my mouth I will want to eat meat (like most people). You'd be better off suggesting more research into food printers.  nevertheless We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
E03084	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact. therefore We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
E03085	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability. It only requires a person's higher capacity to be compassionate, respectful and most of all dedicated to our environment's needs. Who wouldn't want such qualities to become our society's norm? therefore We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
E03086	Even if you believe you are unable to follow a plant-based lifestyle you must appreciate the effectiveness and dedication to the environment of those individuals who do. therefore We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
E03087	There is no reason other than egotism to be against such a proposal. therefore We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources
E04003	Good idea. These camps can be managed by the UN. The EU can send illegal immigrants to these camps. So they will not be on EU soil. From the camps they still can apply for asylum. therefore We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from
E04004	Europe has signed the UN charta on human rights. Also, Europe has the resources to design a fair and safe migration system so that the death of refugees in the Mediterranean sea stops. therefore We should create a migration system that reflects European values.
E04005	Immigrants from non-European countries are also growing old.   nevertheless We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
E04006	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments. nevertheless We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
E04007	Integrating an immigrant into the EU is costly. nevertheless We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
E04009	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.  therefore We should have legal migration channels.
E04010	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions. therefore We should have legal migration channels.
E04011	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights.  therefore We should have legal migration channels.
E04017	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially article 14, states: 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.' therefore We should create a migration system that reflects European values.
E04018	Living in Europe is not a human right. Illegal migrants are willing to break a law and risk their lives (and the lives of their families), while unable to undergo the proper legal and established process and paperwork. nevertheless We should create a migration system that reflects European values.
E04055	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell.  nevertheless We should have legal migration channels.
E04056	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands. nevertheless We should have legal migration channels.
E04057	Immigrants cannot work because they don't speak the required language. nevertheless We should have legal migration channels.
E04058	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result.  nevertheless We should end illegal pushbacks.
E04059	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU. nevertheless We should end illegal pushbacks.
E04060	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution. therefore We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
E04061	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person. therefore We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
E04065	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights. therefore We should end illegal pushbacks.
E04068	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries. therefore We should end mass migration together.
E04069	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely.  therefore We should end mass migration together.
E04073	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.  nevertheless We should end illegal pushbacks!
E04074	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.  nevertheless We should end illegal pushbacks!
E04093	It has been proven in many studies,  that immigrants will not cost Europe money but enrich our economy, as well as in so many cultural ways. It will not cost Europe more than the profit they ultimately contribute therefore We should be realistic wrt. migration.
E04094	Refugees want to find a safe place in order to live. People are HUMAN. therefore We should be realistic wrt. migration.
E04095	I am ashamed that I am European right now. We are keeping refugees behind walls and on islands like savages. They don't want to run from their home country. Who are we ok to deny them the right to exist? therefore We should be realistic wrt. migration.
E04116	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!   therefore We should be aware of migration due to climate change
E04117	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them.  We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.  therefore We should be aware of migration due to climate change
E04135	This single migration policy should include that:  Brussels (EU) handles the paperwork and logistics. Including, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants.  therefore We should adopt a single migration policy.
E04136	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration. therefore We should adopt a single migration policy.
E04150	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.  nevertheless We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
E04159	Europeans should retain control of our homeland, just as everyone else should theirs. therefore We should adopt a single migration policy.
E05006	'Fair' taxation is a vague concept. Taxes are complex and countries want to avoid double taxation.  Countries should be able to set their own taxes in a way that matches their spending and the needs of their citizens. I am against global taxes and against double taxation. nevertheless We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states
E05007	The technology-enabled economy of abundance without human exploitation you can endorse it. We should not hamper automation, instead, we should rethink morals about work. Let the robots do all the bad jobs and let human beings be free to pursue a creative and meaningful life therefore We should further develop robotization
E05008	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions. therefore We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
E05009	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research.  This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic.  These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project. therefore We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union
E05038	It would be a better idea to abolish the European Parliament. It has become an ideological Kabuki Theatre. The Commission should be entirely under the control of the sovereign member states, of course, who remain the masters of the treaties. nevertheless We should abolish the European Council
E05041	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.'  The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector. nevertheless We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation
E05057	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council. We have seen this many times when the EU-MS have tried to find a common stance on foreign policy issues but one has been able to deter the will of all the other countries. This is not a democratic way.   The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election.  therefore We should abolish the European Council
E05058	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda. therefore We should abolish the European Council
E05065	Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress. therefore We should abolish unanimity voting
E05075	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto. nevertheless We should abolish unanimity voting
E05077	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform. therefore We should abolish unanimity voting
E05078	Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again. therefore We should abolish unanimity voting
E05086	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport.  therefore We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
E05091	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice. nevertheless We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
E05092	I think the EU should be in charge of this project, instead of national governments trying to link it up and everything should be financed with the EU budget. therefore We should create a pan-European train company
E05093	A common train network would be a strong alternative to air- and even the car-travel if it is done properly with the right services and prices. For freight, this would significantly reduce truck distances and thus significantly reduce pollution.  therefore We should create a pan-European train company
E05095	Today we live in a system where our public healthcare system is organized on a for-profit healthcare system, where we develop knowledge through taxpayer institutions and then let companies patent this knowledge for profit this has to change, we shouldn't let the greed of capitalists extort us, the EU should work to DISMANTLE all patents and make healthcare issues for all. The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now. therefore We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
E05100	Space mining may be neat science fiction, but I doubt it could ever become a commercially feasible activity. Aside from the environmental impact of launching vehicles into space, moving the mined materials to Earth would pose its own challenges. Entry into the atmosphere and arrival on Earth is dangerous. Having thousands of tons of mined matter go through this process seems destined to end up with frequent disasters. nevertheless We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems
E05103	Members should adopt measures to end unpaid Internships causes they are a form of exploitation of young people. therefore We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
E05109	This way all EU countries have access to a single database which will reduce paperwork and registration and provide immediate and informed service without the risk of complications, especially in regard to medical history.  therefore We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU
E05110	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive. nevertheless We should embrace the future of GMO
E05114	The EU Database should be made accessible for health studies and prevention in order to establish a European Basic Health care industry to overcome future pandemics. therefore We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU
E05117	Instead of banning anything, we should create better alternatives. When the high-speed rail line (320 km/h) between Strasbourg and Paris was opened, the number of flights between Stuttgart and Paris dropped dramatically, due to decreasing demand. nevertheless We should ban domestic air traffic
E05123	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses. therefore We should decriminalize drug use
E05128	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force. nevertheless We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
E05132	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all!  Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world.  Radioactive rain - cool ;-)  nevertheless We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory
E05134	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets.  therefore We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
E05135	If an employee receives part of his salary in the form of car and petrol, he will naturally use it more than he would otherwise, be less inclined to explore alternative ways of transport and opt for a bigger more polluting vehicle than what he really needs. therefore We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
E05137	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years. therefore We should embrace the future of GMO
E05138	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect. therefore We should embrace the future of GMO
E05144	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap. nevertheless We should ban unpaid internships in the EU
E05147	No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly.  Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this. nevertheless We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU
E05149	How would you know how many cases where companies and employees rely on their cars? How would you differentiate between needs and luxury? nevertheless We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees
E05150	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this.  nevertheless We should deprivatize the healthcare industry
E05151	Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature.  Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose.  Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known). nevertheless We should embrace the future of GMO
E05152	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now. nevertheless We should embrace the future of GMO
E05153	Unfortunately, vaccination has shown that it is unable to curb the contagion and therefore the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the EU COVID digital certificate is not able to guarantee the safety for which it was designed, demonstrating that it is primarily a tool of discrimination without real usefulness in containing contagion therefore We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate
E06001	Eurocrats must learn to act within the space afforded them by the European Treaties. Their grandstanding and theatrics are counterproductive therefore We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity. 
E06002	To begin with, stop using the labels “Europe” and “European” to name the EU institutions and initiatives. Do not forget that there are parts of the EU that are not part of Europe (the Spanish territories of the Canary Islands and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, for example, belong to Africa from a geographical point of view); also, that there are parts of Europe that do not belong to Europe (the UK and Switzerland, to name only two); the EU and Europe are not synonyms: Cyprus is a member state of the EU, but 'if' geographically it is Europe, so must be Turkey. therefore We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity. 
E06021	Sexual offences and other serious crimes giving rise to psychological trauma must be excluded from limitation periods, as it is often impossible for victims to remember, let alone report, within the limitation period. therefore We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses
E06034	The rule of law varies from country to country, due to the fact that the concept developed in each country under the influence of local traditions. It's impossible, and superfluous to develop a uniform, EU-standard conception of the rule of law.  nevertheless We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law
E06035	'War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength'... and now censorship is free speech. nevertheless We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
E06037	We have made huge strides in ending sex-based discrimination in Europe. I think we can say that - but for a few details - this issue has been resolved.  'Gender' is a political concept made out of whole cloth. One is certainly free to imagine oneself to be a pink unicorn, but in the eyes of the law and society, he or she remains a man or a woman. nevertheless We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender
E06051	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense. nevertheless We should fight racism in the EU
E06066	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions. We have the perfectly fine EU Treaties as the foundational documents of the EU. They must be followed to the letter.  nevertheless We should create a common constitution
E06072	We need to protect citizen sovereignty against bad players (be it the state, private entities, or other individuals).  therefore We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
E06073	Facial recognition can and will be used against each of us by governments and corporations, based on who we are and what we look like. It will create societies of fear, anxiety, and suspicion. therefore We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
E06074	Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest, and not to be discriminated against.  therefore We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU
E06080	Yes, child abuse is a terrible crime, but there must be another way, which won't introduce surveillance of all. This surveillance would affect all people and violate their rights to privacy. It could (and probably would) end up abused by hackers, totalitarian regimes, etc. for censorship of free speech.  There is no such thing as a backdoor only for the good guys. therefore We should abolish Chatcontrol
E06081	Chatcontrol is a harmful norm: it violates the secrecy of correspondence, increases the indiscriminate and unreasonable surveillance of citizens, allows governments and providers to experiment with tools that can be used for worrying purposes therefore We should abolish Chatcontrol
E06082	Chatcontrol harms minors as well — it shifts attention to risks online, but abuses occur mainly offline: in families living in poverty and degradation; in the structures that should help them; in EU-funded refugee camps, or in countries with which we have diplomatic relations.  therefore We should abolish Chatcontrol
E06090	Who gets to decide what is 'hate speech'? Should the promotion of feminism be considered hate speech against men, or is only hate speech when you don't agree with someone? nevertheless We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech
E06096	Europe should choose a common language.  This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language.  therefore We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language
E07024	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work.  nevertheless We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.
E07041	It has been proven in many studies,  that immigrants will not cost Europe money but enrich our economy, as well as in so many cultural ways. It will not cost Europe more than the profit they ultimately contribute therefore We should be realistic wrt. migration.
E07042	Refugees want to find a safe place in order to live. People are HUMAN. therefore We should be realistic wrt. migration.
E07043	I am ashamed that I am European right now. We are keeping refugees behind walls and on islands like savages. They don't want to run from their home country. Who are we ok to deny them the right to exist? therefore We should be realistic wrt. migration.
E07090	This single migration policy should include that:  Brussels (EU) handles the paperwork and logistics. Including, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants.  therefore We should adopt a single migration policy.
E07091	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration. therefore We should adopt a single migration policy.
E07097	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!   therefore We should be aware of migration due to climate change
E07098	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them.  We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value.  therefore We should be aware of migration due to climate change
E07127	Europeans should retain control of our homeland, just as everyone else should theirs. therefore We should adopt a single migration policy.
E07139	Immigrants from non-European countries are also growing old.   nevertheless We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
E07140	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments. nevertheless We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
E07141	Integrating an immigrant into the EU is costly. nevertheless We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.
E07146	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children.   therefore We should have legal migration channels.
E07147	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions. therefore We should have legal migration channels.
E07148	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights.  therefore We should have legal migration channels.
E07155	Behavior and habits change slowly when a new direction is pointed out. People become less satisfied with changes the older they get. EU needs time for the goodwill of the people for permanent changes. Then a new EU foreign policy can be established.  therefore We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world
E07156	I envy no country that is not already very wealthy and has no view of any union. They will be a play ball between the greater powers. The EU is a necessity that is comparable with the worker's unions in the 1800 industrialization. Therefore the EU has to decide what role it wants to play in this coming world order. therefore We should finally decide on the EU’s role in a multipolar world
E07160	You should endorse the creation of the European Army to defend the interests of European countries, fight against trafficking (humans, drugs, etc.), and be used as the arm of genuine European diplomacy. therefore We should establish a European Army.
E07161	Europe has signed the UN charta on human rights. Also, Europe has the resources to design a fair and safe migration system so that the death of refugees in the Mediterranean sea stops.  therefore We should create a migration system that reflects European values.
E07169	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially article 14, states: 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.' therefore We should create a migration system that reflects European values.
E07170	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.  therefore We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
E07171	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.  therefore We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.
E07174	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty.  nevertheless We should end illegal pushbacks!
E07175	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration.  nevertheless We should end illegal pushbacks!
E07176	I think it is extremely important to upgrade our relations with the former Eastern European countries and in that way move us in the right direction. It is now they need us the most. The area around the Black Sea has enormous potential. They have a growth zone that moves from western Europe to the east and at the same time a growth zone that moves from south China to the north.   therefore We should establish a Russian interest including EU policy.
E07192	By focusing on the well-being of people, particularly disenfranchised people, the EU can arrive at a more complete and sustainable vision of global peace and prosperity. therefore We should adopt a human security approach, for a stronger European Union.
E07245	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell.  nevertheless We should have legal migration channels.
E07246	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands. nevertheless We should have legal migration channels.
E07247	Immigrants cannot work because they don't speak the required language. nevertheless We should have legal migration channels.
E07250	Living in Europe is not a human right. Illegal migrants are willing to break a law and risk their lives (and the lives of their families), while unable to undergo the proper legal and established process and paperwork. nevertheless We should create a migration system that reflects European values.
E07254	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result.  nevertheless We should end illegal pushbacks.
E07255	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU. nevertheless We should end illegal pushbacks.
E07266	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights. therefore We should end illegal pushbacks.
E07272	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries. therefore We should end mass migration together.
E07273	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely.  therefore We should end mass migration together.
E07275	It is neither in the interests of the EU nor Russia to split a long common history. The dialogue must never stop,  With respect and trade, interpersonal exchange, and further expansion of what almost ended in 2014. Here I am thinking of space exploration, and joint development of vehicles, aircraft, etc. Our time horizon must be long-term - back to where it once was and beyond - based on how the world changes. The economy of scale is completely dominant today.  therefore We should consider Russian interests in the EU policy.
E07280	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity. therefore We should adopt an extension of the application of qualified majority voting arrangements
E08023	You owe the fact that you can drink your coffee in public to the people who got vaccinated and thus made the virus a little more manageable. nevertheless We should abolish covid digital pass
