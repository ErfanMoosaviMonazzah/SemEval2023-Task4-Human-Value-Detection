D01035	[C] We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism [/C] [A] [P] This bill gave exclusive powers to the ‘National Investigation Agency’ (NIA).

D01036	[C] We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism [/C] [A] [P] Labelling organisations as terror organisations and labelling individuals as terrorists are quite different. If a person is named as a terrorist, he/she will face social exclusion and will be devoid of livelihood opportunities even if he/she proved otherwise. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone 67% of the cases ended in acquittal, which means they are probably innocent. [/P]	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
D01037	[C] We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism [/C] [A] [P] If someone is booked under UAPA, the burden of proving their innocence is on them.

D01038	[C] We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism [/C] [A] [P] This will provide more police powers to the central government. The provision of naming individuals as terrorists can be misused. For example, recently several civil activists are termed as Urban Naxals. If anyone opposes the government, they will be vulnerable to be framed as terrorists. Because this amendment made it easier to label anyone as a terrorist.

D01040	[C] We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism [/C] [F] [P] To prevent the violation of human rights, four-stage scrutiny is added.

D01041	[C] We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism [/C] [F] [P] Till now, only organizations were designated as terrorist organizations, but not individuals. The loophole in this is the individuals of the banned organizations are forming new organizations and carrying out terror activities. This amendment bill for the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists, thereby terror attacks can be prevented.

D01051	[C] India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country [/C] [A] [P] At present, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure the security of data. On the other hand, developed countries already have an efficient infrastructure. So, rushing toward data localization may not be a wise step. Because without efficient infrastructure, the data is prone to cyber-attacks. And the risk is severe here because it is financial data.

D03022	[C] Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings [/C] [F] [P] Banning firecrackers in some places currently having pollution at its peak like Delhi-NCR will obviously bring down the poisonous emission of gases which has deadly effects on the entire balanced ecosystem.

D03038	[C] Marital rape should be criminalized in India [/C] [A] [P] The most misused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to file a case on a husband and his family in case of dowry harassment.

IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates against married women for using the section on their husbands. Though one can file a case under the domestic violence act for marital rape, not terming marital rape as a crime will deter the victims from filing cases.

D03057	[C] Triple Talaq should be abolished [/C] [F] [P] Triple Talaq is a provision in Islamic personal law that allows men to divorce their wives by saying Talaq three times. Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination, and the right to live with dignity because this provision is available only for men and not women.

However the same is not true with the complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt about the genuinity of the case.

Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.

They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems.

A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not moved an inch since 2019. There have been attempts of making progress in adopting a common European asylum system and forming an EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while also stressing its aim to closely monitor migration routes and maintain situational awareness. This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.

Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers.  [/P]	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.

E04151	[C] We need a single immigration policy. [/C] [A] [P] The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter.

E05005	[C] The EU should implement a common pension fund [/C] [F] [P] The EU has some rules on how social security systems are coordinated (Regulation 883/2004/EC). EU rules ensure that the pension rights accrued in each country are added together and paid out by the pension insurance institution of the Member State of affiliation. But the bureaucratic nightmare is probably just as guaranteed.  A better solution would be a transparent and digital platform that collects pension entitlements from all EU member states. That way, every citizen would have an overview of his or her pension entitlements at all times, not just until when they are due. [/P]	[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E05010	[C] The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.  [/C] [F] [P] The standardized retirement age would not only be fairer in an open market, but it would also (and even more so in the future) prevent any complexities with being paid their retirement for those who have made their contributions in different Member States throughout their lives. Even though there is to be at least a central system for this (a step in the right direction), one will only receive a share of one's retirement from a particular Member State once one reaches the retirement age of that Member State.

E05013	[C] The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms [/C] [F] [P] The EU needs to focus on simplifying and standardizing European processes and procedures associated with public management and creating efficient and effective anti-corruption mechanisms.

E05016	[C] The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency [/C] [A] [P] There is a reason why these states don't want to join the common currency: their economies are more flexible and doing far better without it. If we really want more countries to start using the euro, we need to make the euro better, not pressure or force others into our inefficient system.

E05017	[C] The EU should implement a common pension fund [/C] [F] [P] I find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice. Just as I can move myself, my family, furniture, car, and bank accounts freely within the EU, I should have the same right to move and merge my pensions into a single unit.

E05018	[C] The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.  [/C] [A] [P] Retirement is often funded by taxes and taxes are decided by each member state.

E05019	[C] Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU [/C] [F] [P] The COVID crisis has shown, that we are very vulnerable.  Critical industries must stay in Europe.

E05026	[C] We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability [/C] [A] [P] The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step.  [/P]	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
E05027	[C] We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability [/C] [F] [P] Real democracy cannot do without economic democracy.

E05028	[C] The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU [/C] [F] [P] The undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.

E05029	[C] The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU [/C] [F] [P] Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.

E05030	[C] The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe [/C] [F] [P] As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.

This requires more transparency and accountability, in particular when it comes to access to documents and democratic decision-making. The 'Better Regulation' approach of the Commission which focuses on cutting costs and burdens prioritizes business interests over general interests and should be abandoned.

E05036	[C] There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU. [/C] [A] [P] No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget.

E05039	[C] We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU [/C] [A] [P] First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union.

Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings.

Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence.  Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start.  If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially.

Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right.

Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing.

E05120	[C] We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy. [/C] [F] [P] Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future.

E05121	[C] Public transport in EU cities should be free [/C] [F] [P] I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener.  In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.

E05124	[C] We need a European Clinical Registries Platform [/C] [F] [P] A common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data.  The data should be accessible for public research and used for monitoring public health e.g. by European institutions [/P]	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

E05126	[C] The EU needs a European research center [/C] [F] [P] During the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states.

E05127	[C] The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat [/C] [A] [P] I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced.   When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.

E05146	[C] The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat [/C] [A] [P] I think forcing people to eat a limited amount of meat is totally the wrong way because of the following reasons:  1. It would cause so much more bureaucracy  2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat?  3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.

Do you have any idea what the psychological impact of these kinds of messages is when you blast them at people all day every day for over a year?  Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick.

The dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle vs Greenpeace case, which recalls the definition of the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit that presuppose the destruction of human embryos.

Meanwhile the “European Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030” hardly mentioned people with intellectual and neurological disabilities.  Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities.

This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU.  Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose.

Whether we are speaking about minority protection, language rights, or cultural values. We can see every day that the EU is constantly retaliating against the Hungarians in Transylvania, when, despite the legislation in force, it ignores the lawlessness and atrocities committed against the Hungarians as a native minority.

Better monitoring and trade union involvement are needed to assess and report youth unemployment and NEET rates.

[/C] [F] [P] I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence.

E07163	[C] The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

E07166	[C] There should be centers of excellence in science and education [/C] [A] [P] There has to be better funding for research, but it should not be administered top-down.

E07167	[C] There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism [/C] [F] [P] I strongly agree with this proposal that trade and investment policy should be reformed, especially, that greater attention should be paid to environmental aspects.

E07177	[C] The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South. [/C] [F] [P] The EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life.

E07178	[C] There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism [/C] [F] [P] Economic interests should never be at the expense of social and environmental policy. It is of utmost importance that the protection of workers’ rights and the rules we agreed upon with the Paris Agreement on climate change are at the heart of trade and investment policy. As the EU belongs to the global market, we must guarantee decent jobs that are sustainable, as well as collective, independent representation of workers in trade unions.

It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy.

E07195	[C] The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately  [/C] [F] [P] I opt without a doubt that the Balkan countries should be already accepted as EU members so that their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU.

Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately.

E07227	[C] The EU needs a single market for news [/C] [F] [P] We have a deficit in democracy in the EU because of the lack of coverage of European affairs in our media.

E07228	[C]  Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity [/C] [F] [P] The unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation.

E07233	[C] Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa. [/C] [F] [P] Only if Europe has an energy partnership with Africa Europe will be able to produce enough clean energy.

E07236	[C] The EU should also guarantee territorial integrity against threats from Turkey and other Middle Eastern regional powers. [/C] [F] [P] I wholeheartedly agree. Securing our neighbors and allies has to be a priority. The only thing that causes me some dismay is Turkey being a part of NATO.

[/C] [F] [P] The European flag should be systematically displayed, in addition to the national flag, on any facade of an embassy or consulate of a European country. This would enhance the image of the European Union in addition to synergies like the pooling of support services.

E07248	[C]  The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world [/C] [A] [P] Democracy and civilization are the essences of Europe and the EU must uphold those values. For me, the word civilization is also to be civil, which in some way is the opposite of being militarized.  The EU should not be a superpower.  Nuclear detergence should be enough.

E07257	[C] Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference [/C] [F] [P] Norway and Iceland can provide their external point of view toward EU policy at the conference.

E07264	[C] The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world [/C] [F] [P] The European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides. And as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are doing constantly dividing work between member states. As all successes start in your head, perhaps some attention should be allocated to the media. The EU has a clear chance to become one of the major poles of this multipolar world order.

E07265	[C] There should be an enlargement of the European Union. [/C] [A] [P] It's not a good idea to pursue further enlargement. The greater the territory, the harder it is to control and keep problems from appearing. Every large empire in history fell because it grew to such size that it couldn't be properly managed and ruled over.

E07276	[C] The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed [/C] [F] [P] Large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).

E07277	[C] There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism [/C] [F] [P] The EU needs to both promote and uphold the highest social and environmental standards in its internal as well as external policies.

E07279	[C]  The European Union shall guarantee its territorial integrity against threats from Russia and shall seek to eliminate the influence of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe. [/C] [F] [P] The integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about.  Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development?

E08001	[C] The EU should extend the model of Pooling & Sharing European military resources beyond air transport.

E08003	[C] The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states [/C] [F] [P] I am all for the creation of a European army, but for that, the question of the command of this army must also be resolved.

E08004	[C] The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states [/C] [F] [P] I am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction. So NGOs and development cooperation must be involved. An army that can fight must also be able to build. We therefore also need a civilian army in Europe. I would also like an army consisting of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army. Please also take into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objection, also as in the German army. [/P]	[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
E08005	[C] The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states [/C] [F] [P] Absolutely right. Europe needs an army for continental defense. Conscription must be introduced at the European level. The army must have the most modern weapons to deter Russia, Turkey, and China. [/P]	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
E08008	[C] The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states [/C] [F] [P] In principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.

E08009	[C] The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states [/C] [F] [P] I agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.

E08015	[C] The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states [/C] [F] [P] A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics. [/P]	[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
E08016	[C] The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states [/C] [F] [P] On the one hand, we have Russia killing countless Ukrainians and committing sabotage in Britain and the Czech Republic, and on the other hand, we have reluctant United States that is switching between isolationist and interventionist policies every 4-8 years.   I stand convinced, that in order for the European Union to move forward, it must begin to introduce measures for the security of both, the current member states as well as the future member states that are endangered due to foreign aggression and bring the responsibility of continental safety firmly in our own hands. If Europe is to find the peace it must have the means to create peace by being able to protect itself against hostile foreign influences.

E08017	[C] Food whose production has been subsidized with EU funds should not be allowed to be exported to developing countries.

Export yes, but then no more subsidies for these products. [/P]	[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

E08019	[C] Food whose production has been subsidized with EU funds should not be allowed to be exported to developing countries.

E08020	[C] The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states [/C] [F] [P] The EU cannot endlessly lean on America or NATO. America has proven to be fickle and NATO has its own problems, such as Turkey, which is outside the EU and has threatened Greece. The EU needs its own independent solution.
