This is not just a problem with Political Parties but a lot of Government and Private bodies too.	train
D01081	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act	in favor of	Political funding is believed to be the fountainhead of corruption. The citizens have the right to know where the political parties are raising these funds from, how they spend these funds, and the basis of their decisions. Crony capitalism will be hugely curbed if political parties are brought under RTI Act.	train
D01082	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act	in favor of	Under the IT Act, political parties do not need to disclose donations that they get below INR 20,000. An informal study done in 2010 on 6 key political parties shows that they raised Rs 700 crore. 95% of the amount was raised by amounts below Rs 20,000. There is a high possibility that the political parties use this loophole to their advantage.	train

Political Parties go on to form the government. The government policies are then governed by the party’s ideology. Thereby, it becomes essential for political parties to come under the ambit of RTI.	train
D01085	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act	against	If political parties come under the RTI, it will affect their smooth internal functioning. Rivals may use RTI to malign each other. Also, since the political parties are not connected to the public directly, an RTI would be invalid.	train
D01093	We should subsidize higher education institutions	in favor of	Indians as a whole consider educational institutions as job machines, we expect to enter unemployed and come out with employment. We don’t realize that we will have to upgrade our skills to become worthy of employment. This is the reason that more than 80% of engineers are unemployable and the figures are even worse for the non-engineers.	train
D01094	We should subsidize higher education institutions	in favor of	 Though we have been establishing national-level institutes for the past 40 years, we haven’t been investing to maintain their standards. Funds are needed for quality education. Even the top Indian institutes lack proper infrastructure, labs, resources, etc. And even whatever is available is just for the sake of passing the students in the examination and sitting idle the rest of the time.	train
D01095	We should subsidize higher education institutions	in favor of	Today no problem has a single solution and no new technology is related to a single discipline. We need multiple inputs from multiple disciplines and our institutes have failed in doing so.	train

D01102	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming	against	Achieving excellence in anything takes time. Through graduation, students gain so much knowledge in the relevant field. So, it’s easier for employers to train these students for the industrial requirements.	train
D01103	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming	in favor of	Any skill can be learned and mastered even if we do not have a degree in that. And programming is no exception.	train
D01104	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming	in favor of	Even if someone has a degree in IT, they have to learn so many things to get into the IT job, because there is a gap between the industrial standards and the skills that are taught in Engineering colleges. Moreover, as technology is constantly evolving, even if someone has prepared themselves for the industrial standards in their graduation, they have to learn new technologies continuously to stay relevant in the job market. So, as the learning curve will be there even for IT students, students from non-IT backgrounds can also learn these things and can get into IT jobs.	train
D01105	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming	in favor of	The number of IT jobs is increasing at a rapid rate due to the tech revolution. So, there will be more jobs in the IT field. And if the recruiters are very strict about the degree, they may miss a large pool of talent, who are of a non-IT background. 	train
D01106	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming	in favor of	Now, we have so many online course platforms through which we can learn almost any skill from experts. We can also get certificates if we pass the tests. So, as Tim Cook said a 4-year degree seems old and traditional. 	train
D01107	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming	in favor of	In many of India’s engineering colleges, we can easily pass the subjects even if do not have much knowledge in those subjects. That is the reason many companies are not able to find suitable talent even if there are so many eligible graduates. So, the willingness to become an expert in the field is more important than a degree. 	train
D01108	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming	against	If a student from non-IT background chose to start a career in the IT field, the efforts they put into graduation will go in vain.	train
D01109	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming	against	Even though the new programming languages are replacing the old ones, the basic concepts are the same for almost all the programming languages. So, the one who has a degree in coding will have an advantage over the student from a non-IT background.	train
D01110	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming	in favor of	People switch careers even after working in one field for several years because our interests do change. So, when someone can do this while having so many personal responsibilities, it is much easier for youngsters to learn a new skill. 	train

D01114	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme	against	 It has been seen that it is difficult to retain employees in lean times when they are on variable pay schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when business is good, but they do poorly when business is bad. In times of slow business, even top salespeople might have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent living. If the market is slow and commissioned workers can’t earn enough, they may look for other employment opportunities. In lean times, fixed wages can be more effective at keeping employees from leaving for other opportunities.	train
D01115	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme	against	Variable pay can lead to unhealthy competition between employees. They become less willing to help each other. Team co-operation may get affected negatively. In the long run, relations among colleagues may turn bitter. Whereas, in fixed pay schemes, the employees are able to maintain cordial relationships in the office.	train
D01116	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme	against	Mostly, sales jobs have a variable component. This might negatively impact the employee’s attitude towards customers. They may force the customers irrationally just to make profits for themselves. They might overstate the price to the customers just to make more profit. Whereas, an employee with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relations with the customers, striking the right balance in their approach.	train
D01124	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good	in favor of	The huge data we produce every day is analyzed and fed into our devices through algorithms that we end up giving more and more control of our lives to the gadgets.

D01126	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good	in favor of	After a daily 10-hour shift from Monday to Friday most of us prefer to stay at home on the holidays. We surround ourselves with laptops, TV, and mobile and use them in cycles for Netflix, sports, social media, etc. (thinking that we are relaxing) rather than going out. We prefer and are more comfortable with online chatting instead of talking to people for real. There are fewer meaningful relationships nowadays because of all the above factors. We have started preferring isolation.	train
D01127	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good	in favor of	Nuclear technology is a very efficient alternative to non-renewable energy resources.

D01140	The world does not need religion anymore	in favor of	Religion has served its purpose of uniting people, setting up structures in society, and developing trust and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are thriving towards objective realities, and religion is an inter-subjective reality and now the only thing it does is create differences in the world, brainwash people, develop animosity for other beliefs, and provide rituals that are just shortcuts to becoming a good person. (A Muslim may pray 5 times a day; a Hindu may pray daily for hours in temples; a Christian may go to church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities).	train
D01141	The world does not need religion anymore	in favor of	In the past, every unknown thing dealt with religious beliefs. But now Science & Technology has taken over everything.

D03037	Marital rape should be criminalized in India	against	Consensual sex can also be termed as rape if the wife is willing to file a false case. There will be no proof to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men based on the mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.	train
D03038	Marital rape should be criminalized in India	against	The most misused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to file a case on a husband and his family in case of dowry harassment.

D03039	Marital rape should be criminalized in India	in favor of	Sexual violence violates human rights, irrespective of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates against married women for using the section on their husbands. Though one can file a case under the domestic violence act for marital rape, not terming marital rape as a crime will deter the victims from filing cases. Every law on the planet is prone to be misused. That doesn’t mean that we should not have laws in order to avoid false cases.	train
D03041	Cryptocurrencies should be legalized	against	There will be no sense of security. We cannot sleep peacefully because the cryptocurrency’s value keeps on fluctuating. Standard currencies fluctuate too, but not as high as cryptocurrencies. If the value of standard currency falls, we can still afford to live in our country, because the fall of currency value impacts all fields.

D03057	Triple Talaq should be abolished	in favor of	Triple Talaq is a provision in Islamic personal law that allows men to divorce their wives by saying Talaq three times. Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination, and the right to live with dignity because this provision is available only for men and not women. Women are subjected to live in fear of being unilaterally divorced by their husbands. This violates their right to live with dignity.	train

D27014	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions	in favor of	Some other temples also ban women, and some temples ban men. If it is the same situation with Sabarimala, people wouldn't have bothered about it. But treating menstruation as impure and banning women of reproductive age is regressive and need to address.

D27037	Men are silent sufferers in this modern world	in favor of	These days, every man is considered as a potential rapist. If a woman makes a false molestation complaint against a man out of revenge or any other motive, society is more likely to believe the woman's words. Society and media exposes the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in genuine cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However the same is not true with the complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt about the genuinity of the case. What if the sexual harassment case against the man is a false case? Some people think like men can take anything. False molestation cases will result in the irreversible loss of reputation and causes mental agony to the accused and his family.	train

Do girl's parents not 'influence' her?

E01061	Intensive livestock farming should disappear	in favor of	In Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal feed. In determining how much subsidy a holding receives, the area of the holding is decisive. In other words, a lot of land, a large amount of subsidy. This results in cheap animal feed and, ultimately, intensive livestock farming. Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.	train

E02008	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights	in favor of	It is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU.

E02009	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions	in favor of	The cohesion funds have become a mechanism for local oligarchs and political elites to maintain their power and influence within national contexts, thus resulting in utilizing EU funds for their own personal or political gains and withholding the benefits from the people in cities and regions.	train
E02010	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions	in favor of	An increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.	train
E02011	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from	in favor of	This will add to the transparency and fair competition.

E02012	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from	in favor of	Protection of the rights of those who actually produce the services and products that constitutes the European market is nothing but self-evident.

E02014	Europe should have stronger borders	in favor of	Europe can no longer afford to neglect to defend its external borders and promote policies that favor illegal migration and fuel human trafficking. Strong and effective borders are the pre-condition to any aspect of a common migration policy.	train
E02015	European Union should help young people to train in refugee countries	in favor of	This should help to tackle the causes of lack of prospects and absconding from these countries in order to increase the willingness of young people to stay in their homes	train
E02016	Frontex should regularly publish transparency reports	against	Frontex interfering with the national border guards doing their sacred duty to protect the border, and then sending anonymous reports to criticize these brave men and women is quite abhorrent. 	train
E02017	Immigrants should integrate through work	in favor of	I work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate.  The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country.  There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes.  Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.	train
E02018	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	against	We haven't got enough jobs and money for everyone in Europe! Stop immigration! However, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia have it! These countries can therefore welcome migrants instead of funding hundreds of mosques in Europe!	train
E02019	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	against	Why do we even let in migrants who do not speak the language of the country where they wish to reside? Migration is bad for the nations and degrading for the migrants. We must work to end mass migration. 	train
E02020	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	against	Indigenous Europeans have no obligation to take in any more migrants, and neither do they want to. This is being forced on us.	train
E02021	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	in favor of	It's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).	train
E02022	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	in favor of	Each migrant in the European Union must be given the possibility to integrate even if the refugee status is not clear. Integration programs could support this development in all cases.	train
E02023	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	against	No, Europe is not a colony. Immigration has been devastating.

E02025	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	in favor of	Most of the time migrants have trouble fitting into society because of the language barrier and hate. Providing them with language lessons could reduce the tensions around migration, and improve the migrants' integration.	train
E02026	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	in favor of	Knowledge of the host country's language is essential for integration. When migrants understand the local language, studies show that their values tend towards those of the host countries over time. 	train
E02027	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	in favor of	It is essential that European principles and values are taught to migrants, including an explanation of the reasoning behind these principles and values. It would be best that this is provided both in the person's mother tongue and in the language of the host country. 	train
E02028	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	against	For more than 50 years immigration has been going on uncontrolled and unchecked. No changes need to be made before we have an agreement that people ignoring our immigration laws should be detained in repatriation facilities with no chance of re-entering the EU. Once we agree on that we can start talking about funds and resources for those who do deserve help. 	train
E02029	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	in favor of	Working in sectors in ample need of workers, such as the agricultural fields, will help to integrate immigrants once their situation has been legalized. And above all, education is needed, an intensive integration education both in the language (of course) and also culture: history, philosophy, literature, etc.	train
E02030	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs	against	Europe needs more women to have children and raise them in a good manner, which helps transmit our culture: our culture is a praise to the world and must be saved from globalization invasion and destruction.	train
E02031	International cooperation with third countries in the field of migration should be developed	against	Mass migration is an evil that hurts the nations as well as the migrants themselves, who suffer indignities and risk their lives. We must end mass migration. This requires that migrants be helped as close to the origin of migration as possible. 	train
E02032	Migrants should be housed in EU bureaucrats' neighborhoods	in favor of	EU bureaucrats who have enabled immigration must be named and a democratic process for removing them from power must be put into place.  Democracy must prevail over this multicultural fascism.	train

E02037	The EU leadership must enter into strong agreements with the countries where immigrants come from, in order to retain them in their countries	against	If we want to uphold to our standards and what the EU represents, we shall help those immigrants and give them the tools to help us make our homes better and multicultural so when the chance is presented they can then have a way to help their countries. Simply blocking them out of our region and neglecting them won't solve anything. We will only make unnecessary enemies.	train
E02038	The EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy	against	The World, in particular Africa and the Middle East, is experiencing a huge population explosion. They seem not to be able to cope with it as China did.  Who is going to take all these millions of refugees which result from it?  Also, consider that the integration of one non-western immigrant costs 167.000 euros.  If the EU intends to survive it has to stop more or less all migration.	train
E02039	The EU needs s common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	in favor of	We need to ensure fair redistribution of refugees across Europe and ensure better integration of refugees and applicants for international protection into the workplace. More concrete and fairer European policy on economic migration, to establish legal channels for entry and to foster an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as a key tool to address the social impact of migration flows.	train
E02040	The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees	in favor of	The EU should attract the world's most talented and most entrepreneurial. There was an attempt to reform the blue card directive by the Junker commission in order to create a new streamlined EU-wide visa category, similar to the short-lived Schengen visa. The holder of the new blue-card-like visa would have the entire EU labor market at their disposal. 	train

E02042	The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees	in favor of	Compared to most anglophone countries, Europe has been quite timid in attracting talent across the globe. Too few people know of and make use of the EU Blue Card. The EU is a destination of choice for migration and refugees from developing and some neighboring countries.	train
E02043	The EU should have common taxation and social policy	in favor of	The future is 'work mobility'; thus we need to simplify taxation, enhance remote working opportunities, and enable inter-country recruitment for companies.	train
E02044	The EU should have open borders with poor countries	against	Many migrants simply refuse to fight to change things in their own countries. Once a migrant told me 'I want what you have, why should I sweat to build it back in my country when here it's ready to be taken?' No thanks.	train
E02045	The EU should have open borders with poor countries	against	If we need work force, we should look for Europeans to come, not for Afrikans, Arabic, and Muslims.	train

E02047	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens	against	Promoting, organizing, and directing mass migration is a crime against humanity. Lukashenko is currently committing exactly this heinous crime.

E02052	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens	in favor of	It is necessary that member states better share the efforts of receiving asylum seekers upon arrival at EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to frontline countries.  The EU should develop a joint approach to support the frontline countries to assure that asylum seeker are provided adequate care, assistance, and protection upon arrival and are quickly distributed evenly throughout the EU for status determination.	train
E02053	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens	in favor of	The root causes to leave their home countries should not be overlooked. The EU and its member states need to increase efforts to make the countries of origin more liveable.	train
E02054	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens	against	Successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the greatest existential threat to the EU.  Even more so than the CO2 threat.	train
E02055	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	against	More illegal and legal migration will lead to more unemployment, lower wages, more insecurity, and less sustainable social systems.	train

E02057	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	against	I disagree, each country must be sovereign to establish its migration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.	train
E02058	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	in favor of	Across the EU, young people are continuing to face a number of significant challenges to enter and get a  stable position in the labor market. They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are particularly affected. So we need a fairer migration policy but also consider migrant needs (and challenges) in other policy areas.  	train
E02059	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	in favor of	The shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens.

E02061	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	in favor of	There is a need for a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not moved an inch since 2019. There have been attempts of making progress in adopting a common European asylum system and forming an EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while also stressing its aim to closely monitor migration routes and maintain situational awareness. This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.  	train
E02062	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	against	The EU should treat economic migrants with more vigilance. They cannot be the solution to the aging European population. We need more focus on border control to curb illegal migration. 	train
E02063	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	in favor of	The human rights-based approach should be the core principle. Legal channels for entry and fostering an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as key tools to address the social impact of migration flows are necessary.	train
E02064	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	in favor of	Migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers. 	train
E02065	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	in favor of	Although there is an immense increase in the number of TCN migrant workers, there is no adequate policy in protecting their rights. Anyone in Europe should be entitled to the same worker’s rights, no matter where they come from. As migration is an issue that is dealt with by all countries, we must find a common answer at the EU level.	train
E02066	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	in favor of	The Dublin Agreement leaves EU member states with an external border completely alone to deal with the challenge of immigration. This must stop! Not only because solidarity in the EU is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overburdening of states left alone with this challenge creates intolerable situations for the refugees.	train
E02067	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	against	Before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have nice conditions in the EU, we should first focus on ensuring that our own people can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.	train
E02068	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	against	Each country must have the right to choose based on a democratic vote, how many immigrants they want to accept.

E02070	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	against	Giving immigrants more rights will lead to the forced displacement and eventual erasure of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what's happening to the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China is genocide then so is this. This idea proposal is not grassroots, it's astroturfed lies to hide the fact that our migration policies are totally undemocratic and forced onto native Europeans.	train
E02071	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment	in favor of	A fair, sustainable, and open Europe benefits everyone.  Our common future demands actions to put human rights, solidarity, and social justice on top of the agenda. 	train

E02073	We need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing	against	Mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU.  The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU.  Almost all people are without a useful education.  There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.	train
E02074	We need to develop a partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union)	in favor of	Agreed, BUT only on one condition: that every euro be spent under the joint control of local and European officers.

E04090	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in.

E04140	There should be no illegal migration	in favor of	This is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.	train

E04142	There should be no illegal migration.	against	What does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece. 	train
E04143	There should be no illegal migration.	against	What does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate.

E04151	We need a single immigration policy.	against	The EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter.  The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality. 	train
E04154	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries. 	in favor of	Europe should look at the European people first.

E05005	The EU should implement a common pension fund	in favor of	The EU has some rules on how social security systems are coordinated (Regulation 883/2004/EC). EU rules ensure that the pension rights accrued in each country are added together and paid out by the pension insurance institution of the Member State of affiliation. But the bureaucratic nightmare is probably just as guaranteed.  A better solution would be a transparent and digital platform that collects pension entitlements from all EU member states. That way, every citizen would have an overview of his or her pension entitlements at all times, not just until when they are due.	train
E05010	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans. 	in favor of	The standardized retirement age would not only be fairer in an open market, but it would also (and even more so in the future) prevent any complexities with being paid their retirement for those who have made their contributions in different Member States throughout their lives. Even though there is to be at least a central system for this (a step in the right direction), one will only receive a share of one's retirement from a particular Member State once one reaches the retirement age of that Member State.	train

E05013	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms	in favor of	The EU needs to focus on simplifying and standardizing European processes and procedures associated with public management and creating efficient and effective anti-corruption mechanisms. This will reduce the financial resources to be made available to the most relevant areas of intervention at the EU, country, and regional Levels.	train
E05016	The EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency	against	There is a reason why these states don't want to join the common currency: their economies are more flexible and doing far better without it. If we really want more countries to start using the euro, we need to make the euro better, not pressure or force others into our inefficient system. 	train
E05017	The EU should implement a common pension fund	in favor of	I find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice.

E05018	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans. 	against	Retirement is often funded by taxes and taxes are decided by each member state. So each member state should also be the one who decides how those taxes are spent. For some countries, a retirement age of 65 may be unaffordable or undesirable, while for others it may not.	train

E05026	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability	against	The European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step. 	train
E05027	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability	in favor of	Real democracy cannot do without economic democracy. If the major decisions about our future life (investments, inventions, production) are made outside social control, then there is no real democracy.  Without proper social consultation, there is no prospect for a fair Europe.	train
E05028	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU	in favor of	The undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.	train
E05029	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU	in favor of	Having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.	train
E05030	The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe	in favor of	As we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.	train
E05031	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability	in favor of	We need to strengthen citizens' trust in the European project! This requires more transparency and accountability, in particular when it comes to access to documents and democratic decision-making. The 'Better Regulation' approach of the Commission which focuses on cutting costs and burdens prioritizes business interests over general interests and should be abandoned.

E05036	There can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU.	against	No. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget. And until the democratic deficit and other systemic problems in the EU are fixed, it's good that the budget is kept at 1-2% of the total EU GDP.	train

E05039	We need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU	against	First, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.	train
E05040	We need a common EU TV channel free of charge for people in all Member States	in favor of	The language barrier and a weak influence on local thinking, allow local propaganda to pass on distorted and untrue information about what is happening in the EU to their citizens.

E05048	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU	against	In Germany, the President of the Executive is not elected by the people directly either. The reason for this is the horrible experience during the Third Reich. The Parliament - as the only constitutional institution being directly elected - has a stronger stand if the President is not elected directly. However I definitely support, that the Parliament becomes stronger and more influential. 	train
E05049	EU citizens should be allowed to direct vote for more decisions	against	Direct democracy is too open to manipulation by populists and malefactors via social media. A transparent representative democracy with a solid lid on lobbyism is to be preferred.	train
E05050	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press	in favor of	Transparency is the first key to real democracy. Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings.  Or think about all the meetings between diplomats (Coreper) and civil servants (working groups and committees), where ±90% of decisions are made, for the Council to be rubberstamped. Meetings that most citizens don't even know about. 	train
E05051	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press	in favor of	In order to strengthen democracy in the EU, Council meetings should be open to the public and the press.

E05053	The EU should synchronize national elections 	in favor of	The only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans. This must change.	train
E05054	The EU should synchronize national elections 	in favor of	The political composition of the European Council - and therefore the EU’s political center of gravity - continuously changes during the EU political cycle, thus preventing clearer government majorities to emerge within these two European Councils.   	train

It would be only a mediatic competition among 'plastic' leaders.  Something very similar to The Simulacra (Dick's 1964 science fiction novel).  We are not a 'nation', we are a confederation of nations.	train
E05060	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability	in favor of	Decision-making is today made unilaterally minding short-term economic interests and employers' demands.

By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The right to self-determination also has its economic content which gives the people the right to freely ‘dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law.'	train
E05064	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability	in favor of	Europe needs a proper parliament including a right to initiative combined with strong involvement of social partners, e.g. through European Social Dialogue or the partnership principle in regional funds.	train
E05066	Voting for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory	against	High voter turnout is usually desirable, but it's a symptom, not the root cause. Forcing people to go to the polls doesn't mean they will make more informed choices. Besides, voter turnout is a good metric that tells us where the potential problems of voter disenfranchisement are which is the first step to addressing them.	train
E05067	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.	in favor of	After so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	train
E05068	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.	in favor of	Self-determination is a basic collective human right. Catalans practiced this right in 2017.  Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence.  Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start.  If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially. This crucial step will enforce European democracy, the Democracy of Citizens that feel free and respected within European borders.	train
E05069	The EU should focus on pragmatism	in favor of	The attempt to shove the postmodern version of liberalism down Europeans' throats has contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU. 	train
E05070	The EU should focus on pragmatism	in favor of	Pragmatism was in the EU’s DNA since its inception, but this is sadly no longer the case. The current EU is not a moral authority, it is a political organization based on mutual interests and political diversity.	train
E05071	The EU should focus on pragmatism	in favor of	Pragmatism entails the protection and promotion of European interests, banning top-down ideology, and respecting the cultural and political individuality of every Member state.	train

E05073	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU	against	No, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.	train
E05074	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU	against	The European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else. An elected head of the Commission would make nonsense of the principle of independence that is vital to the trust in the Commission's job. He or she would be beholden to the group that elected him or her and make the job impossible.	train

E05079	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.	in favor of	There are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.	train
E05080	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.	in favor of	The right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.	train
E05081	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders.	in favor of	In a democracy, people have the right to decide on any issue that affects their lives. If more than half of the inhabitants of a region want to form an independent state, they have the right to do so. Going against it is going against the will of the majority of citizens, and therefore, against the very essence of democracy.	train
E05082	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU	in favor of	European political parties should be independent of national parties.

E05087	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists 	in favor of	Intensive Care Medicine deserves to be added to the Annex V, as well as all citizens of the EU deserve top standards of critical care and safety when admitted to this demanding environment.	train
E05088	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists 	in favor of	The pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves.   We saw patients in very critical condition being moved away from their families from one Member State to another to receive treatment while allowing the doctors to move would be much more efficient and less life-threatening for the patients. 	train
E05089	EU needs an action plan against digital addiction 	against	Technology brings people together when they are distant, accelerates bureaucratic procedures, it allows us to work from home or from any country in the EU or outside. It allows for an immense flow of information to be easily accessible to us. As long as people do not want to do illegal online activities, it is each person’s individual decision what to do with their own online time or how much time they might want to be online.	train
E05090	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health	in favor of	The COVID-19  pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.	train
E05094	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health	in favor of	Such a platform if it provides youngsters with free or at least affordable mental-health assistance, will help them finally able to overcome our society’s barriers to taking care of our mental health and emotional well-being. 	train
E05098	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat	against	Horrible idea. Next, you will limit water or air?! This is not the way to move on climate change.

E05099	Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond	in favor of	The range of primary care services should be available to all patients universally, with special emphasis on those at the margins, often in most need.	train
E05101	EU countries should slightly reduce health insurance contributions for all citizens who do not use tobacco products 	in favor of	I think increasing taxes on tobacco could do a similar thing.

E05102	Pay-as-you-go public health insurance funds should only be used for the most serious illnesses	against	This only works if you're young and healthy, otherwise, you're a bad risk for private health insurance and it will become even more expensive	train
E05107	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work	in favor of	It seems like a no-brainer to say something like this, but actually the way, we handle soil, must change massively to halt the climate crisis and mitigate its consequences. Thus we need to recultivate and restore abandoned and contaminated places and shift agriculture to regenerative agriculture or restoration agriculture. We need to stabilize family farms and make them ecologically, financially, and socially sustainable. We need between big and medium-sized farms and also highly productive smallholder farms and wildlife reservoirs. This all depends on a lot of labor, engaged people, and legal and conceptual infrastructure. Having all this in place will foster urban areas as well. 	train
E05108	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work	in favor of	If rural areas are to become more attractive to live in and work, it is essential to bet on innovation and the creation of quality jobs	train
E05113	Doctors should be paid based on how many people they successfully treated	in favor of	Unfortunately, in our society, a healthy person is not profitable. Pharma is a big business, doctors are being paid for prescribing drugs.  Modern healthcare should be preventive. Doctors should be encouraged and paid for curing people and keeping them healthy.  Good quality healthcare should be accessible in every part of the world and should be free as there is nothing more important than human life.	train

E05116	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy	in favor of	Raising prices in the energy sector cannot be the solution in the fight against climate change. The European Commission allows international firms to increase their prices, and as a result, household costs are rising at an incredible rate. The EU should definitely revoke these decisions, and instead of placing the burden on its own citizens, it should instead support them to lead a more sustainable way of life. The green transition should not be a heavy burden borne on the average citizen’s shoulders 	train

E05119	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.	in favor of	In France, political repression fueled by rightwing ideology and ignorance led cities like Marseille to develop rampant crime that fed on the lucrative market of cannabis. Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing. 	train
E05120	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.	in favor of	Tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.	train
E05121	Public transport in EU cities should be free	in favor of	I think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener.  In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.	train
E05122	Public transport in EU cities should be free	in favor of	The incentive to provide free public transport in European cities in the future would make it easier for people, especially in the cities, to accept and appreciate that there will be fewer and fewer cars. People who benefit from current examples are happy about it. 	train
E05124	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform	in favor of	A common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data.  The data should be accessible for public research and used for monitoring public health e.g. by European institutions	train

E05126	The EU needs a European research center	in favor of	During the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states. Gathering the strength of the 27 member states in research and health could be a real asset for the EU and its citizens, but also for its influence overseas and its independence.	train
E05127	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat	against	I believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced.   When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.	train
E05129	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat	against	No, this is a horrible idea to force people to go vegan. While I agree that we, as a society, are eating too much meat, which is bad for both the environment and our health, this will only create tension and anger towards the EU. 	train
E05130	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat	against	I have no illusions that rich and influential people will find a way to get as much meat as they want and then distribute it on the black market.	train
E05131	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health	in favor of	Public services of good quality and universal access are key to ensuring fairer, more inclusive, and equal societies. They have a clear redistributive effect and help steer development in a more sustainable direction. The Covid-19 crisis if anything helped to prove the crucial role that the public sector and public services play and must continue playing!	train
E05133	Alternative medicine should be more accepted	in favor of	Traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine is a safe and efficient way to improve well-being, and happiness and prevent illness. Also, an innumerable amount of people have got significant palliation or even total cure in cases, which the official health care system, unfortunately, couldn't help. This is clearly an area, where countries, civilizations, and schools of thought could learn a lot from each other.	train
E05139	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat	against	The government does not have any right to use the taxpayer's money to propagandize the people to encourage what to eat and not to eat. It is not the responsibility of the government.	train

E05145	The EU needs a European research center	in favor of	I think the problem in the EU is the incompetence to establish inventions in the market. There are lots of inventions that are made and funded by public EU research facilities brought into the market by small startups. In the end, they are picked like ripe fruits by the US or Chinese companies where the big money is made.	train
E05146	The EU government should encourage people to eat less meat	against	I think forcing people to eat a limited amount of meat is totally the wrong way because of the following reasons:  1. It would cause so much more bureaucracy  2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat?  3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.	train
E05148	Coronavirus protection should be advertised on TV and social media	against	That's a terrible idea. The government propaganda machine is already going at full steam. Do you have any idea what the psychological impact of these kinds of messages is when you blast them at people all day every day for over a year?  Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick. Instead, they have willfully created panic. Just like your ad would.	train
E05154	Public transport in EU cities should be free	in favor of	I think the EU should subsidies troubled cash-strapped cities to reduce ticket prices or completely remove any charges so that people are vivisected to hop on the bus rather than in the car. As I student, I would have been in the city center a lot more and spent money around the shops if I could afford the bus fair in the first place. 	train

E06004	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health	in favor of	Juridical protection of dignity, right to life, and integrity of every human being from conception are of fundamental importance for the future of Europe.  The dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle vs Greenpeace case, which recalls the definition of the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit that presuppose the destruction of human embryos.	train

E06013	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders	in favor of	Mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.	train
E06014	Germany should start paying reparations share for any damaged countries of Europe up to 100 years after its attack on international society	against	Will Russia also pay their share? Will Austria pay for starting WW1 or will it be Serbia? Will Poland and Hungary pay for occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia in 1938/1939? Will France pay for starting napoleonic wars? It is time to forget what happened almost 100 years ago and focus on the future and I say that as a Czech citizen whose country was occupied by Austria, Germany/Poland/Hungary and then by SSSR and all eastern satelite states.	train
E06015	People with disabilities should be more represented 	in favor of	According to the United Nations Convention on the rights of people with disabilities, the European Union “shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities” on political decisions that concern them. Meanwhile the “European Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030” hardly mentioned people with intellectual and neurological disabilities.  Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities.

E06019	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders	in favor of	To have any credibility when addressing foreign countries regarding issues of human rights violations, curbs on the freedom of speech and press, democracy, and more, the EU must ensure that its Member States meet minimum standards on these fronts too.	train
E06020	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders	in favor of	Current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.	train
E06022	The EU needs a free but correct press	in favor of	I totally agree, maybe would be glad if a press company could be sanctioned for misleading information, or even if it repeats, they could have their press licenses voided. It is crazy how much misleading information is out there, many people are sharing it and nobody is taking responsibility for it.

E06026	The EU should ensure a free, independent, and functioning judiciary in its Member States	against	The administration of justice is a member state competence. Shadowy attempts by federalist institutions to enhance their influence at the expense of the sovereign member states are contrary to the letter of the EU Treaties, counter-productive, and have contributed greatly to the crisis of the EU by alienating national institutions. This is especially the case for courts. Several member states' high courts have declared the ECJ ultra vires (acting beyond its powers). This lawlessness on the part of federalist institutions must stop with immediate effect, and we must reaffirm the principles of subsidiarity and conferral. 	train
E06027	The EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states	against	It is unacceptable.

Have we not seen sufficiently clearly in the past two decades where 'democracy export' leads?! Freedom bombs and human suffering everywhere.  No, the EU must fully respect the sovereignty and national characters of all nations of this world. And that includes its own member states.

E06058	The EU should enforce minority protection	in favor of	It seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU.  Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv. 	train
E06059	The EU should enforce minority protection	in favor of	Unfortunately, the values and rights are interpreted and exercised differently in the states of the European Union. Whether we are speaking about minority protection, language rights, or cultural values. We can see every day that the EU is constantly retaliating against the Hungarians in Transylvania, when, despite the legislation in force, it ignores the lawlessness and atrocities committed against the Hungarians as a native minority. Furthermore, the European Union should give priority to all situations in which Hungarians in Transylvania are victims of discrimination.	train

E06062	EU institutions should prioritize the struggle against all forms of racism, also anti-Muslim bigotry, and antisemitism	against	Judeo-Christian values are the cornerstone of European civilization - they deserve special protection because they made us who we are today.  Mass migration from people with cultures totally alien to Europe is the phenomenon that most threatens EU security and cohesion. Everyone's human rights must be respected, but illegal migrants are criminals and should be treated as such, not pampered. Mass migration must end.	train
E06063	The EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it	against	'We most definitely do not need a wider definition of 'gender-based' anything. 'Gender' is a politicized left-wing concept. I certainly encourage wider protection from violence against women and girls. That should most definitely include protection from the violence and coercion young women face from 'trans' activists. We also want nothing to do with 'intersectionality' which is a neo-Marxist concept of overlapping oppressions. No one is being oppressed in Europe.	train

E06069	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector	against	Ensure equal opportunities for girls and women, provide them sufficient maternity leave, and institute guarantees that will protect women's careers who choose to have children. Those are the steps we need, and most EU countries already have them (not that they cannot be improved). There's absolutely no need for quotas. 	train
E06071	The EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom	against	We are all for equal rights and opportunities for women, however, modern feminism has gone so far beyond the pale that it can no longer be supported.  The BBC has recently found out that 'Some lesbians are increasingly being pressured and coerced into accepting trans women as sexual partners' - in effect fourth-wave feminism has reached the point where males are once again telling females who to have sex with. This must stop.	train

E06076	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech	in favor of	The internet has provided unprecedented opportunities to express and comment on almost anything.

How can we oppose such acts – such as insults, vulgarism, or threats on social networks? Or can everyone say anything on the internet?	train
E06077	Ideology should be aimed at popularizing the best human qualities and stopping everything that is directed against a human	in favor of	Aggression, division, and violence we see in mass media should be stopped.

E06087	The EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector	against	Every harpy screams 'more (black) women in power' until Candace Owens appears. Clever, charming black woman, but she is too clever, pro-freedom, and conservative, and that is the problem. So it isn't about women, it's mere greed and desire for power and influence.	train

This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21. 	train
E06091	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people	in favor of	The situation of young people is difficult. Temporary jobs, precarious contracts, civic contracts replacing regular employment, forced self-employment, lack of basic social protection, and even age-discriminatory practices (also on the basis of age) are still the norm for millions of young people who are trying to make their way in the labor market. They need urgent help!	train
E06092	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities	in favor of	Esperanto is politically neutral: it is not used by any European nation.

E06094	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities	in favor of	Esperanto is linguistically neutral: The language was created with the principle of internationality in a European context. It’s democratic: There are no native speakers of Esperanto, or better yet not any monolingual speakers of Esperanto. Everyone has to learn it as a second language. As a result of this nobody will have an advantage over others and nobody can feel like a 'stranger' since nobody can feel like a 'native'. Everyone is respected regardless of their origin and not discouraged from learning the language.	train
E06095	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people	in favor of	I agree. Young people should have a voice in policymaking. Regulation needs to reduce forms of precarious work.  It is time to expand collective bargaining coverage to all forms of work. It is essential to introduce a right to decent housing and policies capping rents and limiting property market speculation. we urgently need investment to achieve this.

E06099	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people	in favor of	To prevent precarious conditions, we must put in place quality standards, they must be binding for all jobs created under EU and National recovery plans. Better monitoring and trade union involvement are needed to assess and report youth unemployment and NEET rates. At the moment these numbers hide forced mobility, involuntary part-time employment, and work in a grey and informal economy. Urgent measures are needed to fight youth unemployment and precarious working conditions in sectors where young people are overrepresented (tourism; gig economy…).	train
E06100	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people	in favor of	I agree. Stable, quality jobs and adequate social protection for everyone are necessary.

E07003	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people	in favor of	Young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	train

E07027	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union	in favor of	Maybe while helping economic integration in Africa to happen, we will discover that we could go further in our own EU development. We could foster transnational companies which operate on both continents but not primarily the very big ones.

E07035	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix.

E07106	We need a single immigration policy.	in favor of	But also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...	train
E07107	The EU should join NATO	in favor of	It would be easier if the EU joined NATO. The internal rivalry between the single EU states would stop. Also, the issue of a legitimate European army would be solved. However, I am not sure how this would work out in legal terms. Federations have already joined NATO, rather than individual states, but what would be the status of the EU?	train

E07110	There should be a European Common Defence and Security Alliance	in favor of	We need to revisit the idea of a defense union that is independent of NATO. National armies of EU states should be able to cooperate. This includes the same equipment, the same training and the same battle language.  	train

EU does not equal to Europe	against	For sure you are technically or geographically correct, geographically Europe extends to the Ural mountains  But in this forum, we initiate a common thinking on the future of Europe, which we associate with the EU. So please avoid any reference to arrogance and don't corrupt this respectful debate. 	train
E07116	The European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government.	against	We certainly need levels of government at the global, regional, and local levels. Equally, we absolutely need democracy at the global, regional, and local levels. Neither the European nor the national and regional parliaments should be abolished because of the need for global governance for the planet. 	train
E07118	The European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers.	against	The European Parliament has developed avenues for a common foreign and defense policy and should exercise its role this way. Also, there are prerogatives of a parliament to guide and control the external policies of the EU.	train
E07119	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries. 	in favor of	Europe should look at the European people first. It is not fair for the working classes to have to live within the ruins of multiculturalism while the middle class supports immigration from within their gated communities.	train
E07120	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries. 	in favor of	Immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration.  	train
E07121	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union	in favor of	Africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas. If these young people create for example remote learning opportunities for African students, we should not only sponsor such projects but make exchange possible for young people in Europe to create similar items for example to foster MINT skills throughout Europe.

E07129	The EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe.	against	Europe has more than enough ideological disputes within its own borders. We must settle those first - by falling back on a previous, more classical liberal position that was uncontroversial for most of our citizens. Countries outside the EU must deal with their own problems as best they can. Less interference from Europe is the order of the day, not more. 	train

E07133	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe.	in favor of	Unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.	train
E07134	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries. 	against	What are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money? The religion? The food? Their political system? And then reevaluate each year? This comment is plain ignorant. 	train
E07135	United in diversity should be a concept for reconciliation in the Western Balkans.	in favor of	I believe the EU should expedite the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans, to help them evolve and facilitate the reconciliation problems. As you say, Montenegro for instance is a peaceful country that has made efforts to overcome past troubles, and that too should be acknowledged.	train

E07138	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East.	in favor of	I would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence. 	train
E07142	We need Integrated migration and border policy.	against	Migration has totally gotten out of control. The EU refuses to see the magnitude of it. Hundreds of millions like to migrate. All people without the right language and fitting education. The massive numbers of immigrants threaten the existence of EU societies, through crime, poverty, and housing shortage. 	train
E07143	We need Integrated migration and border policy.	against	 Refugees can obtain a visa at an Embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within a week of arrival.	train

E07149	 Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.	against	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity.

E07150	 Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity.	against	Abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will only serve larger nations in the union and small member states would lose all their power and slowly turn into puppets of the larger nations instead of equal partners 	train

Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1,55.  It is this high birthrate that keeps them poor. There is almost nothing the EU can do about it.	train

E07163	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council.	in favor of	It is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.	train
E07166	There should be centers of excellence in science and education	against	There has to be better funding for research, but it should not be administered top-down. Let researchers decide rather than politicians. Do not stifle research by bureaucracy. At the time being, with large consortia getting multi-million euro grants, the application process has become too complicated for most researchers. Rather invest in reproducible, transparent, open research. 	train
E07167	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism	in favor of	I strongly agree with this proposal that trade and investment policy should be reformed, especially, that greater attention should be paid to environmental aspects. The current situation is unsatisfactory and even dangerous. 	train
E07172	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately 	in favor of	I opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.	train

E07177	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South.	in favor of	The EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life. To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.	train
E07178	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism	in favor of	Economic interests should never be at the expense of social and environmental policy. It is of utmost importance that the protection of workers’ rights and the rules we agreed upon with the Paris Agreement on climate change are at the heart of trade and investment policy. As the EU belongs to the global market, we must guarantee decent jobs that are sustainable, as well as collective, independent representation of workers in trade unions.	train
E07179	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country.	in favor of	Helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country they are living in are critical to successful integration. Language and norms of the job market and workplace should also be built in.	train
E07180	There should be better EU relations with Russia	in favor of	Distance is very important when trading.  Security is even more important in relation to distance.  It is without thought to escalate conflict and it is not in the interest of Europe.  Russia has centuries of history with European allies. It is in the interest of Europe to not leave Russia solely to China. We can all prosper.	train

E07189	Esperanto should be the common language for the European Union.	in favor of	'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!	train
E07190	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council	in favor of	The idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy. 	train
E07191	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council	in favor of	It should be the common goal of EU diplomacy to change the workings of the UN as it is. The security council is a relict of the emerging post-WW2 order and the influence of the Cold War.	train

E07197	We need a stand-alone European army.	in favor of	Turkey is encroaching on EU territory, Russia is sending its army to the Ukrainian border, and what can we do? Nothing, because nobody is taking us seriously. Our threats are empty and get ignored, and our diplomacy is weak. It's time for the EU to be recognized as a strong force that can and will protect its people and its interests.  	train
E07198	We need a stand-alone European army.	in favor of	A European army is not only needed to attack and defend but to give weight to European words. 	train

E07210	Europe should stand together!	against	Do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately.

E07233	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa.	in favor of	Only if Europe has an energy partnership with Africa Europe will be able to produce enough clean energy.

E07236	The EU should also guarantee territorial integrity against threats from Turkey and other Middle Eastern regional powers.	in favor of	I wholeheartedly agree. Securing our neighbors and allies has to be a priority. The only thing that causes me some dismay is Turkey being a part of NATO. It was a good idea in 1951 but clearly, Turkey must be out off the map now.	train
E07237	The European Union should visible on the facades of the embassies and consulates of European countries.	in favor of	The European flag should be systematically displayed, in addition to the national flag, on any facade of an embassy or consulate of a European country.

E07248	 The EU should play a major role in a multipolar world	against	Democracy and civilization are the essences of Europe and the EU must uphold those values. For me, the word civilization is also to be civil, which in some way is the opposite of being militarized.  The EU should not be a superpower.  Nuclear detergence should be enough.   	train

E07264	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world	in favor of	The European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides. And as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are doing constantly dividing work between member states. As all successes start in your head, perhaps some attention should be allocated to the media. The EU has a clear chance to become one of the major poles of this multipolar world order.	train
E07265	There should be an enlargement of the European Union.	against	It's not a good idea to pursue further enlargement. The greater the territory, the harder it is to control and keep problems from appearing.

E08015	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states	in favor of	A European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution.

If Europe is to find the peace it must have the means to create peace by being able to protect itself against hostile foreign influences.	train

D01043	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India	in favor of	At present, most of the farmers in India are following chemical-based farming. But the food produced by excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can cause serious health problems when consumed. So, there is a need to address this, and Natural farming can be a solution to this.	val
D01044	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India	in favor of	Even though organic farming produces healthy and nutritious food, it produces greenhouse gases and thereby contributes to climate change. So, the best alternative is ZBNF.	val

D01046	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India	in favor of	The third agricultural revolution, which is also called as ‘Green revolution resulted in the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Chemical-based farming results in soil health deterioration, heavy water usage for crops, and high input costs. Organic farming was started as a solution to this. But it requires large amounts of manure & vermicompost. So, organic farming is quite expensive. But the Zero-Budget Natural Farming approach will require very fewer input costs and restores soil health and produces highly nutritious food.	val
D01047	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India	against	ZBNF is a cow-based farming practice. So ZBNF will result in an increase in the number of cows. But cows produce Methane, Nitrous Oxide & Ammonia, which are greenhouse gases and hence contribute to climate change. Methane is more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide, which is another greenhouse gas. Comparatively, methane is 25 times more powerful than Carbon dioxide. Nitrous Oxide is 300 more powerful than Carbon dioxide. And hence it is not a totally safe option.	val
D01048	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India	against	The name – ‘Zero Budget Natural Farming’ is confusing. If anyone hears the name for the first time, he/she will think that this approach requires no investment. But it requires investment to spend on labor, cow maintenance, and water. The costs are very low when compared with other forms of agriculture, but it is not completely zero. To avoid this confusion, ZBNF was renamed as Subhash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF). But, it was announced as ZBNF in the budget 2019.	val
D01049	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India	in favor of	We are witnessing farmer suicides in the past few years in several parts of the country. This is mainly because of the high input costs involved in farming. To raise capital, they are forced to take loans and if the crop fails due to various reasons, they are opting for suicide. Zero Budget Natural Farming will prevent farmers from getting trapped in a vicious cycle of debts.	val
D01050	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India	against	In the 1960s, the Green revolution increased food grain production with the aim of achieving food security and preventing famines. At present India’s population is increasing. So we need an abundant food supply. This may not be possible if we completely switch to natural farming.	val
D01062	Referendums are good for the society	in favor of	It can be said that referendums are a direct form of democracy. As the people directly participate in the decision-making, avoiding any manipulation by their representatives.	val
D01063	Referendums are good for the society	against	Referendums at times can lead to ill-informed decisions. Since the general public is politically inexperienced, they may not be able to gauge the long-term implications of their decisions.	val
D01064	Referendums are good for the society	against	Referendums weaken the sovereignty of the parliament, where the decisions are made with thorough discussions and debate among the chosen representatives.	val
D01065	Referendums are good for the society	in favor of	Referendums can educate citizens politically.	val
D01066	Referendums are good for the society	against	Referendums provide an unreliable view, as the general public may have less knowledge about certain issues so they can be swayed in any direction by the politicians through aggressive speeches, false data, etc. And the lack of knowledge will leave no other choice for the people than to believe those facts.	val
D01067	Referendums are good for the society	in favor of	Referendums force governments to do what the people actually want.	val
D01068	Referendums are good for the society	in favor of	The common man has a say in policymaking as he will be the one living under the new set of rules, he will be the one who will be most affected. So, at times the priorities of people are different from the priorities of the government, referendums can set things straight.	val
D01069	India should transition to electric vehicles	in favor of	Vehicular pollution is one of the major causes of air pollution. By switching to Electric vehicles, we can solve this issue. As per the report by the government, with this move, carbon emissions will be reduced by 37% by the year 2030. This will also help in our fight against climate change. As India is committed to bringing down its share of global emissions by 2030 as per the Paris climate agreement, replacing diesel and petrol vehicles with electric vehicles will help us in achieving this goal.	val
D01070	India should transition to electric vehicles	in favor of	As the number of people who are buying vehicles is rising, the air quality will worsen further. So, there is a need to address this challenge.	val
D01071	India should transition to electric vehicles	in favor of	As of 2019, India is importing crude oil for 82% of its oil requirement. By using electric vehicles, we can reduce the dependence on other countries for oil imports.	val
D01086	Consumerism brings more harm than good	against	Though the markets are yet a little controlled, they are freer than before. Consumerism improved the standard of living of the common Indian middle class tremendously. In recent decades, the Indian government has been improving the markets in order to boost entrepreneurial activity.	val
D01087	Consumerism brings more harm than good	against	The middle class benefited tremendously from consumerism. Increased job opportunities, wages, and cheaper goods helped raise their living standards tremendously. The new world order gave them hope that even they could have luxuries like the elite. Through business, they could climb up the social ladder.	val
D01088	Consumerism brings more harm than good	against	On the economic side, consumerism had a positive impact. Due to the increase in wages, people started buying more. Due to increased demand, aided by increased supply (due to the setting up of factories) entrepreneurial activity got a boost. Businesses were set up, jobs increased, wages improved and living standards improved. Overall, the world took a turn for the better. This made everyone look at consumerism (or for them, vanity) in a different light. Instead of being a stigma, it actually became a boon.	val
D01098	Nuclear disarmament is necessary	in favor of	Experts have been discussing that the two major threats in front of us are Climate Change and Nuclear Weapons. And they have been urging for complete disarmament. To some extent they are right. When a nuclear bomb will explode the surface will become hotter than the sun and apart from the mass destruction and deaths, the generations of people and animals who survive will perish for many decades. Reports say that almost 2000 nuclear weapons are kept on high alert throughout the year. Any misunderstanding or miscommunication can lead to a disaster, and with the impulsive leadership we are seeing around the world possibilities are higher than before. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists advanced the symbolic Doomsday Clock by 30 seconds in February, which indicates how world leaders are failing in maintaining peace.	val
D01099	Nuclear disarmament is necessary	in favor of	Several terrorist organizations are also trying very hard to obtain nuclear weapons. Now if by any chance they get nuclear arms there we can’t even imagine the destruction.	val
D01100	Nuclear disarmament is necessary	in favor of	All the countries do not have very high security for their nuclear arms, apart from going into the wrong hands the system that controls them can also be hacked.	val
D01101	Nuclear disarmament is necessary	against	Nuclear weapons are extremely lethal and can wipe out life on the Earth, and have actually worked as a deterrence to full-scale wars. We have seen two world wars, and the second one came to an end with a nuclear bomb being dropped by the USA on Japan. Since then, we haven’t seen any open, full-fledged wars, not because there have been no tensions among the countries and we all are living happily, but because of the reason that most of the developed and developing countries have nuclear arms.	val
D01142	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	against	India has already become a resource-scarce country. We are unable to deliver the basic necessities to genuine Indian citizens, and a large number of additional immigrants will further worsen the conditions. The efficient NRC will help us in identifying illegal immigrants and some steps that can be taken for their deportation.	val

D01145	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	The present process lacks impartiality, transparency, and equality. Updating or maintaining an NRC with such a huge population, and that too people with less income and low literacy is a very tedious task. And all efforts should be made to minimize injustice to anyone.	val
D01146	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	The NRC body and the Foreign Tribunals in Assam are functioning behind the curtains and its functioning is clearly signaling toward the ruling party’s agenda of getting rid of Minorities. Earlier retired judges were carefully selected for Foreign Tribunals but now any lawyer who is above 50 on 25 April 2015 and has 10 years of experience can volunteer for FT and gets a seat. Various online sources have reported that the FT is full of people sharing the ruling party’s ideology and are asked to perform well.	val
D01147	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	People are tired of showing their documents, and proving their identities but the Foreign Tribunals are never satisfied. Minor clerical mistakes have resulted in the listing of Indian citizens as Foreigners. At times FT has gone beyond scope of its power and ordered arrest, detention, revoked ration cards, etc. thus, troubling a poor Indian.	val
D01148	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	NRC increases the feeling of alienation among Muslims and animosity among orthodox Hindus, leading to communal unrest which is already on the rise since the BJP came to power.	val
D01149	We should abolish the National Register of Citizens (NRC)	in favor of	With this faltering mechanism, already poor and helpless genuine Indians will lose their right to work, healthcare and education, and housing.	val
D02041	We should develop Web 3.0.	against	There is no guarantee that web 3.0 will not be controlled by big tech companies. Earlier when the first version of the web came, people expected that it will guarantee free speech and no one can control it like they controlled traditional media such as newspapers and television. But, now web content is largely controlled by big corporations. So, web 3.0 may also turn into the same.	val
D02042	We should develop Web 3.0.	in favor of	Web 3.0 is defined as a decentralized web, where content does not lie in the hands of big corporations. Instead, it uses peer-to-peer infrastructure, so the information cannot be censored by corporations or the government. It is expected to ensure user privacy.	val
D02054	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	against	This can be a threat to privacy because this linking can lead to the profiling of voters. Several states collected caste, religion, and other sensitive information as part of aadhaar data collection. So, this can be misused by some politicians to selectively eliminate some voters based on their caste or any other identity.	val
D02055	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	against	If legitimate voters do not have an aadhaar or if they could not link it due to any reason, they will be removed from the list. For example, some homeless people do not have aadhaar cards yet. In the 2018 Telangana Assembly elections, linking aadhaar cards with Voter ID led to the elimination of 20 lakh voters.	val
D02056	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	against	There are fake and duplicate aadhaar cards too. So, linking aadhaar cards with voter IDs may complicate the issue.	val
D02057	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	in favor of	This can be used to eliminate fake voter cards. Moreover, some people have voter cards in 2 or more areas. These duplicate voter cards can be eliminated by linking Aadhaar cards with Voter IDs.	val
D02058	We should link Aadhaar card with the Voter ID	in favor of	This linking can clear the path to internet voting or e-voting.	val
D02063	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	against	The age of 18 years is considered a legal adult in India. They have voting rights too. But not giving them the right to marry the partner of their choice may work against their rights. In 2018, the Law Commission recommended lowering the minimum legal age of men from 21 to 18 years and suggested keeping both genders’ minimum legal age for marriage as 18 years.	val
D02064	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	in favor of	At present, many girls are forced to drop out of studies for marriage. So, making the minimum legal age for marriage 21 will allow them to continue their studies. Thereby, many more women will go for higher education.	val
D02065	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	in favor of	Teenage pregnancies increase the risk of high blood pressure, anemia, and several other health problems. It can also lead to the death of the mother due to pregnancy complications. So, raising the age of marriage for girls can reduce the chance of maternal mortality.	val
D02066	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	in favor of	Early marriages result in several mental health issues in many girls. So, this move can eliminate this problem.	val
D02067	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	in favor of	As several girls are married at 18 years, they are not having financial independence. This is resulting in dependence on their husbands for survival. The dependence will force them to stay in the relationship even if it is abusive. So, raising the minimum legal age for marriage can empower women and can help them in achieving financial independence before marriage.	val
D02068	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	against	As per the government data of 2017, the average age of marriage for women is increased to 22.1 years. So, the change is voluntary. The change was mainly due to the improving education among women. So, the solution lies in encouraging education for girls, conducting awareness programs on the importance of education, financial independence and the consequences of teenage pregnancies should be conducted instead of passing a law to bring a real change in society.	val
D02069	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	against	At present, child marriages are happening throughout India even after ‘The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, of 2006’. As per the National Family Health Survey (2019-2021), 1/4th of the women aged 20-24 years were married before attaining the age of 18 years. After the pandemic, the number of child marriages increased significantly. So, the problem lies in the implementation. Hence the law alone cannot bring a change in society without proper implementation. Root causes should be addressed before bringing a law.	val
D02070	Indian government should increase the minimum legal age of marriage for girls from 18 to 21 years	against	Several girls are being forced into marriages due to the patriarchal mindset of their families. Until now, many girls of such families rebelled against such forced marriages and married the person of their choice after attaining 18 years with the help of legal support. But now, they have to wait till attaining 21 years. This will be misused by patriarchal families to threaten and control them.	val

D03046	Cattle slaughter should be banned	against	It is not ethical to interfere with the food habits of others.	val
D03047	Cattle slaughter should be banned	in favor of	It is our responsibility to stop cruelty against animals. Article 48 of the Indian constitution mentions that the state should take steps in prohibiting the slaughter of cattle. Many slaughterhouses are still not following the rules to not harass the animals while killing. Animals are subjected to intense suffering at most slaughterhouses.	val
D03048	Cattle slaughter should be banned	against	Taking action against illegal slaughterhouses is the right step, but banning entire cattle slaughter may not be the right decision by the central government. There are food security and livelihood security issues. It is the responsibility of the government to respect everyone’s choices equally.	val
D03049	Hindi should be the national language of India	against	English is an international language and is spoken by most of Indians. So, if Hindi is made the national language, people who cannot speak Hindi will be at disadvantage in many things such as getting government jobs, understanding circulars, etc.	val
D03050	Hindi should be the national language of India	against	Some people are arguing that English is not born in India and hence we should avoid using it. This statement lacks logic because all the technological innovations we are now using were born in different parts of the world. We cannot reject things just because they are not Indian.	val
D03051	Hindi should be the national language of India	in favor of	English is not native to India, but Hindi is.	val
D03052	Hindi should be the national language of India	in favor of	Hindi is spoken by more than half of India. As no single language is spoken by the entire of India, it is much better to make the majoritarian language the national language. 	val
D03053	Hindi should be the national language of India	against	Almost half of India’s mother tongue is not Hindi. There are 22 officially recognized regional languages in India. Making a majoritarian language the national language is unconstitutional.	val

D27010	Hindi should be the National language of India	against	Some people are arguing that English is not born in India and hence we should avoid using it. This statement lacks logic because all the technological innovations we are now using were born in different parts of the world. We cannot reject things just because they are not Indian.	val
D27018	MBAs do not make good business leaders	against	The curriculum and the educational procedure in any MBA institutes lack hands-on practice over live projects in order to train them and give them a chance to work on their leadership skills. Instead of focussing on the technical aspects of business marketing, development of leadership along with interpersonal skills is extremely important.	val

D27090	Reservations in India should be based on economic status	in favor of	Caste divisions are hatred among communities is increasing due to reservations. Many communities in several states of India are fighting to give them reservations. And the consequence is people are increasingly associating with their caste. The interesting fact is that before the first caste census by British government (1881) in India, many people do not even know what their caste is. From then, the idea of caste is deeply ingrained in the Indian society. Now the reservations are making the situation even worse.	val
D27091	Reservations in India should be based on economic status	against	In India, it's easy to hide some income resources and to get a false income certificate. Though the situations are changing for the better, it is not that difficult.	val
D27098	India is safe for women	in favor of	Evil historic practices on women in the pre and post medieval period have been into oblivion. Practices like child marriages, polygamy, ban on remarriages, honor killings, Sati, Jauhar and Purdah are obsolete in today's world. With time, more such practices are being redundant and thus, increasing safety measures.	val
D27099	India is safe for women	in favor of	Women of our country have been and are achieving the epitomes of success and glory every other day. Prominent personalities like Savitribai Phule, Mother Teresa, Sarla Thakral, Kalpana Chawla, Sister Nivedita, Sarojini Naidu, and many more have been conquering their respective fields for centuries.

E01019	Wind and solar energy resources have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects	against	if you want to save birds, you perhaps should think about domesticated cats and making modern buildings more bird-friendly. If you want to save insects, look at the way of land use and agriculture, and create insect-friendly gardens.	val
E01024	We should stop subsidies for fossil fuels and expand the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS)	in favor of	Currently the ETS only applies to certain carbon-emitting industries covering 40% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. To effectively combat climate change 40% is not enough. That is why the ETS has to be expanded to at least cover agriculture and transport as well.  In Addition to the extension of the ETS the subsidies in fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) must be cut in the near future.	val
E01025	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	in favor of	nuclear power plants which, compared to fossil fuel-fired power plants, have decreased carbon dioxide emissions and produce incomparably less toxic substances, which, moreover, are not emitted into the air we breathe, but can be buried deep underground where they will not harm anyone. 	val

E01065	We should use available solutions to make flying more sustainable right now	in favor of	The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used in the aviation sector right now.  SAFs are not made from fossil fuels, but from CO2 that has been taken out of the air recently, either by biological processes or through technology. 	val
E01069	We should not subsidize large agricultural groups	against	Subsidizing big agricultural companies is not the problem here, it's the criteria by which the subsidies are distributed.	val
E01070	We should replace solar and wind energy with nuclear energy	against	In the case of nuclear power, cooling is needed to prevent a meltdown. And if water is not available because of drought or freezing, earthquake or tsunami, etc, these gigantic steam engines have to be shut down, otherwise, they will produce highly hazardous outcomes.	val

E01081	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	in favor of	Worldwide, nuclear power has prevented emissions of 240 billion tonnes of CO2 and prevented 1.8 million lives due to prevented air pollution (Kharecha, Hansen 2013). 	val
E01082	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	in favor of	Nuclear power is safe - there are over 400 nuclear power plants globally, most of which have operated with no issues for the last 40 years, providing 24/7 electricity and preventing pollution and CO2 emissions. In terms of safety, including all accidents and pollution, nuclear power has caused 0.07 deaths/TWh, which is 40x less than natural gas and comparable with wind power (OurWorldInData 2021). 	val
E01083	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	in favor of	Nuclear power takes little space, and unlike wind and solar works 24/7 and 7 years to build on average.	val
E01092	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good	against	There are whole regions that are completely energy-autonomous with wind energy, solar power & biogas - not only in developing countries but in industrialized countries as well. It's not a question of technology, but just of mindset & innovative arrangement.	val
E01093	Wind and solar energy resources do more harm than good	against	Where energy costs for consumers are high in combination with renewables, it's mostly due to political decisions and market set-up, not due to technical issues. Unfortunately, old-fashioned policies have made things very complicated. Wherever energy cooperations can play their part, things become much easier and more cost-effective. If big companies have to deliver it all alone, things become difficult, complicated, and costly, because their structures make it difficult to provide sophisticated setups for communities of small consumers.	val
E01094	We should protect 20% of land in each European country to restore biodiversity	in favor of	This is really crucial in order to stop warming, locally, eventually regionally or nationally, and globally. The more intact ecosystems we have, the more likely we can stop global warming.	val

E01101	We should use waste from the agri-food industry in the ruminant feed chain	in favor of	What is edible, should be given to humans. What humans cannot eat, should be available for animals. What both cannot use, should go to biogas plants. The solid waste from biogas plants can be transformed into excellent compost. Runoff from biogas plants can be treated & provide H2. And the heat from biogas plants can provide heating or other forms of energy.	val
E01102	We should protect bird habitats in built environments	in favor of	Glass is one of the biggest causes of human death for birds.	val
E01103	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	against	Nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable.	val
E01104	We should include young people in decision-making processes considering climate change	in favor of	Including young people in decision-making processes considering climate change could potentially help to address the gap between the widespread official rhetoric claiming a great interest in involving young people in discussion and policymaking when it comes to climate protection and politics in general and the reality that falls too often too short of these declarations.	val
E01105	We should promote the use of nuclear energy	against	We are still living in a capitalism, so, the price will decide and the price of nuclear energy is the only energy price which is increasing steadily, while renewables become cheaper every year. Nuclear was always only subsidiesed by governments and never really standing on their own. The building process is slow, the price is high, no way, this could be a gain - if it weren't for the military. 	val

E02096	We should improve migration policies	against	No more immigration! It has already come at too large of a cost. The EU must provide channels for the European people to democratically vote for the mass deportation of migrants.	val
E02097	We should improve migration policies 	in favor of	The EU could play an important role in combatting misconceptions about immigration.  Immigration needs to be controlled sensibly and immigrants should be taught European values and principles as well as the language of the host country. 	val
E02098	We should improve migration policies 	in favor of	Avoiding non-EU countries to stop migrants’ journey to the EU payments to systemic violation of human rights and dignity.	val
E02099	We should improve migration policies 	in favor of	The only meaningful immigration is when there is a member country with a specific vacancy. That member will also be responsible for the integration (at a cost of Euro 167,000). The EU has only to administer the paperwork and supervise if matters spin out of control. 	val
E02100	We should improve migration policies 	against	It may be great to admit a few talented immigrants, but the EU is now following its steep nose dive leading to the rapid disappearance of Europe.	val
E02101	We should include limited profitability enterprises in the EU treaties	in favor of	I'd like to see inclusive legislation which considers all sorts of social businesses, gives them good protection and possibilities to develop.

For example, taxes on companies, and green taxes (tax on non-recycled items, tax on carbon, etc), as all should be harmonized across the EU.	val
E02105	We should increase the EU budget by including more direct contributions	in favor of	The money from this could be allocated to pan-European projects, new citizen services, etc, tangible and prestigious results that may prompt others to join in.	val
E02106	We should legalize cannabis in the whole EU	against	Europeans must embrace true values that enhance life and standards of living.  Anything related to drugs, in whatever form, degenerates humanity.  Soon enough we will be legalizing 'theft' in an effort to improve GDP and growth, as European colonialists have done in Africa and Asia where oppression and exploitation ruled. 	val
E02107	We should make living wages a human right	in favor of	Many people, even in the richest European countries, work hard, work overtime or have several jobs & cannot sustain themselves. That's humiliating, time-consuming alien to physical & mental health, and poisoning society.  	val
E02108	We should make living wages a human right	in favor of	Nations that have adopted living wages for full-time jobs have highly profited from that step. It's been an economic booster because if people who earn & possess little can afford what they need, they will buy. So they increase demand. Demand increases supply. More supply means more jobs, more suppliers, lower costs, etc. 	val
E02109	We should make pushbacks legal 	in favor of	Pushbacks may not be a nice way of operating. However, Brussels is causing problems by telling the whole World that everyone (7 billion people) has the right to apply for asylum in the EU.  It would be much better by refusing admission to anyone appearing at the border without papers.  The experience is that over 80% of the immigrants are not refugees in danger.	val
E02110	We should make pushbacks legal 	in favor of	We need to legalize pushbacks as a tool to limit illegal migration.	val
E02111	We should preserve European culture	in favor of	We should embrace and protect our culture which stands at the basis of our successful society.

E02116	We should return to the free market capitalist ideals in Europe and stop the advance of socialism and leftist ideology	against	Capitalism and the free market indeed created western wealth. However, the interesting question then is: who benefited from this wealth?

E03015	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans	against	Sounds a little xenophobic. There is no concept of indigenous or aborigenous population in Europe, the only criteria is citizenship.	val
E03016	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	Are IQ test really worth anything? Stick to teaching the language and basic values, the rest will follow.	val
E03017	We should sop unrestricted deforestation and logging	in favor of	Wood should be used as building material & other meaningful products only. Anything else is a waste of resources. No fresh wood for paper, fast furniture 	val
E03018	We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports	against	Please consider this: right now in Africa several million people are half starved, and eat a meal a day at best. They live thanks to cheap agricultural products coming from Europe, because local stuff is too expensive for them.	val
E03019	We should stop destabilizing developing countries by subsidized agricultural exports	against	It will take years before the local farmers will be able to give well paid jobs to the local workers. In the meantime you'll have a famine and a genocide. And I didn't even mention the effects of a sudden huge inflation wave.	val
E03020	We should prohibit certain energy-intensive cryptocurrencies	in favor of	According to BBC: 'Bitcoin uses more electricity annually than the whole of Argentina'	val
E03025	We should improve and modernize our energy infrastructure	in favor of	A green initiative that I can endorse whole-heartedly. Rational environmentalism can save both our planet and our democracy (from the menace of the radical Greens).	val
E03026	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	IQ tests do not prevent ill-intentioned people from entering our borders. Canada aims to receive 400,000 people each year, and how intelligent or skilled they are does not matter. People working in the agricultural fields are being naturalized, relatives are being naturalized.	val
E03027	We should prohibit internal combustion engines	against	Not all combustion engines use petrol as a fuel - natural gas engines are way more environment-friendly	val
E03028	We should sponsor the general population for taking in migrants	against	Integrating one non-western immigrant cost ca. Euro 167,000,-. Who will be paying that ?	val
E03031	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	in favor of	The real problem, even with the war refugees is that once they enter the EU they do not want to return to their countries, even if the danger has passed. They even bring their family and other relatives!	val
E03033	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	This is a huge discrimination.  Everyone should have the chance to develop to a personal level. Or should we all do an IQ-test to stay in our country? Because it could avoid dangerous things like rasicm. 	val
E03037	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste	in favor of	To create value directly in the rural areas, is very important.	val
E03038	We should support local associations for the recovery of bio-waste	in favor of	Making compost out of organic waste and distribute it to gardeners and farmers will help to create value and a better environment.	val
E03041	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable	in favor of	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. They are internationally recognized & very precise. As far as I know, all or most countries have agreed on these goals. The financial sector is starting to implement them and there are already internationally recognized lists which specify the details.	val
E03042	We should make zero/low waste products more affordable	in favor of	We should tax items based on the sustainability goals of the United Nations. This would make it possible to tax exploitation pollution of natural resources, CO2 & other greenhouse gas emissions, violation of human rights or terrible working conditions, no matter if the product is a plastic bag, an unsustainable t-shirt, a service, some food or a complex financial product.	val
E03045	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	Some of the 9/11 Terrorists were well educated. IQ proves nothing, I'd better welcome good people than smart people.	val
E03047	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	I don't see how stopping putting a stop to migration will suddenly impact our eco footprint in that extend. Firstly, migration is in our nature. Without migration you wouldn't be here.  second, the cost of migration is self-sustained.	val
E03048	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	A migrant, with the proper education and support, will in his turn contribute for society, which allows more people to have a fulfilling life.	val
E03049	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	Instead we should look into investing in foreign countries and help building a stable environment.	val
E03050	We should not allow solar power plants to be used to damage nature.	in favor of	I absolutely agree that solar power plants should not be deployed on fertile, arable land & wood should not be cut down to make place for this endeavor. This needs to be regulated swiftly!	val
E03057	We should not produce unnecessary garbage	in favor of	Things that are supposed to serve us for a long time, like a vehicle or telecommunication device or household implements should be designed to last half a lifetime under normal use. The quality of the building material should matter more in that instance, so less focus on recycling.	val
E03058	We should not produce unnecessary garbage	in favor of	Things that are one-time use only, like most packaging and the like, should be radically focused on recycling potential.	val
E03059	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	People from several countries are asking for asylum in Europe in hope of better life conditions. Those people aren’t guilty for being born in those countries and EU should support everyone.	val
E03060	We should include all costs of nuclear energy in our comparisons, for example insurance and disposal	against	If you want to do it for nuclear power, then it would be better to do it for every single kind of energy production methods. It’s also important then to include the complete cycle of all the energies, the human cost, the extraction of primary resources, in the case of renewable energy, take into account the necessary energy storage, and so on and so forth.	val
E03061	We should label products with environmental impact and climate impacts in clear language	in favor of	Extremely important thing for an informed decision of the citizens e.g. in the supermarket.	val
E03065	We should support agroforestry	in favor of	Changes in management practices, and above all the integration of trees in arable and pastoral lands, are key, and could turn agriculture from a net emitter to a net absorber of greenhouse gases.	val
E03068	We should invest in integrated photovoltaic (e.g., over agriculturally used land)	in favor of	Agrivoltaic could be a perfect model for an energy cooperation of citizens to own some greenhouses with photovoltaic & rent them for a small fee to a urban gardening cooperation of citizens, for example. 	val
E03069	We should put a higher tax or a toll on imported meat from abroad.	in favor of	I agree! So perhaps we will have less meat but also less pollution, and much more quality of meat, of air and of environment	val
E03070	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	If we tried to fix the issue by controlling the population, countries like Denmark would need to reduce their population to 1/5 of the current number, to reach sustainable resource use.	val
E03071	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	Instead we need to change our behavior, reduce our consumerism and decrease our overall resource use per person.	val
E03072	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	Instead we need to reduce inequality in between countries and distribute wealth more evenly around the world.	val
E03073	We should promote a plant-based diet	in favor of	The environmental impact of a given product should also be stated on its package and/or in menus in order to raise awareness on the subject.	val
E03074	We should promote a plant-based diet	in favor of	In addition to this, schools and companies canteens should be required to serve mainly plant-based meals in order to reduce their impact and to educate their users.	val
E03076	We should not forget about indigenous Europeans	in favor of	European Union has already forgotten for example about the Ingrian Finnish indigenous nation. We have our own unique flag, our own unique language (that only about 1300 people speak in the entire world), our own land that the Ingrian Finnish lived on before Russia took over Karelia and sent them all to labor work in Siberia, Karelian forests and Estonia.	val
E03079	We should reduce environment pollution by limiting number of people in Europe	against	Stopping immigration as an excuse to not adopt proper anticonsumerist and industry-regulating policies will not solve anything for the environment and will only increase interethnic and interracial tensions.	val
E03080	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	This is against human rights. I think advocating restricting immigration from non EU countries based on education, work skill and language literacy is a legitimate suggestion, but morally IQ tests are not acceptable and as very akin to what would be expected of a ethno-nationalist  authoritarian regime, not a union of democratic institutions.   	val
E03081	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	IQ is not an effective measure of whether they'll be economically beneficial, suited to European jobs  in high demand, likely to integrate/assimilate, their potential to cause crime etc.	val
E03082	We should impose an IQ test to immigrants	against	This just seems like an overtly emotional suggestion that isn't too well thought out. It would cause far more problems that it solves.	val
E03088	We should implement a legislation on aquatic animal welfare	in favor of	Fish are sentient and failure to afford them the same legal protections that we provide other animals is a gross moral and legal oversight.	val
E03089	We should reduce animal farming.	in favor of	We should encourage people to consider the question: 'Do you think it is morally right to torture, mutilate, and kill animals needlessly?'	val
E03090	We should reduce animal farming.	in favor of	We can work together to encourage plant based diets and make the world a better place.	val
E04012	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	in favor of	Many countries have the view that unauthorized asylum seekers should be removed.	val
E04015	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	in favor of	Unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants have no right to be in the country where they are unauthorized.	val
E04016	We should promote awareness in society of what migrants are contributing. 	against	Misconceptions like the view that mass migration is somehow 'good' need to be clearly pointed out.	val
E04026	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	in favor of	Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop the conflict.	val
E04027	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	in favor of	 Bigger financial resources for Frontex and military action in Syria will stop immigration.	val
E04030	We should not have illegal immigrants!	in favor of	We can only employ people in understaffed job fields.	val
E04031	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.	in favor of	Frontex must be given powers and resources to shut down the migratory routes entirely.	val
E04032	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration.	in favor of	 Mass migration is a crime against humanity and has to stop!	val
E04036	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	in favor of	Illegal loopholes in the legislation are enabling illegal migration. Family Reunification has been and remains the biggest channel of migration into the EU.	val
E04037	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	in favor of	The procedure of Family Reunification is already causing major problems in the USA. 	val
E04038	We should rethink the legal state of Family Reunification.	in favor of	Family Reunification creates unbearable levels of migration and acute problems of integration for several EU Member States.	val
E04041	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	in favor of	The European Commission’sportrays migration as an opportunity only, a Fatality that cannot be stopped, and the only solution against aging.	val
E04042	We should stop the European Commission’s Ideological bias toward migration.	in favor of	The European’s Commission communication and political thinking on migration are biased, falsely naïve, and Ideological.	val
E04047	We should stop mass migration.	in favor of	Organizing, promoting, directing and financing mass migration is a crime against humanity.	val
E04050	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers or migrants.	in favor of	No more immigration from non-European or non-first world countries.	val
E04051	We should restrict immigration.	in favor of	Foreigners and immigrants must not be provided the same services and advantages as native people.	val
E04052	We should restrict immigration.	in favor of	We cannot pay for all immigrants. This type of idea is too idealistic and is killing us.	val
E04075	We should protect the European border	in favor of	Only together and with  Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	val
E04084	We should remove illegal immigrants.	in favor of	EU must take action. Help those in need, but only those who respect legal boundaries. Mutual respect is a cornerstone in this subject where we must set limits to protect Europe. 	val
E04086	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.  	val
E04087	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration to EU from non-European or non-first-world countries will lead to an even more competitive advantage for the USA and other countries as our population is shrinking rapidly. 	val
E04088	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Japan was a global superpower once just behind the USA, however, it has a strict immigration policy. Where is it now in global power rankings?	val
E04098	We should protect the European border	in favor of	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years. 	val
E04104	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work!  What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights	val
E04118	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	in favor of	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.	val
E04129	We should punish illegal immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	in favor of	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.	val
E04133	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	in favor of	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex). 	val
E04134	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	in favor of	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.	val
E04137	We should stop integration.	in favor of	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.	val
E04152	We should support Frontex.	in favor of	Frontex is a key agency and is called to play a crucial role in the coming years. Yet, it lacks the necessary political support it deserves to carry out its mission. 	val
E04153	We should support Frontex.	in favor of	 The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	val
E04156	We should stop immigration.	in favor of	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa.  Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans.	val
E04158	We should stop immigration.	in favor of	The organization of mass migration is a heinous crime. No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	val
E04160	We should protect the European border.	in favor of	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border.	val
E05011	We should increase the salaries of artisans	against	I think that people should grow, learn and move into better-paid jobs. Today there are fantastic opportunities, e.g. Artificial General Intelligence is being built, and human anti-aging and even rejuvenation therapies are being developed: these are only a few areas where the most pressing need of humanity is being met. People should move into such jobs. For the manual work - there are robots coming. We should not try to distort market forces and stop development.	val
E05014	We should stop making one-cent coins	in favor of	The convenience of carrying fewer coins is obvious.	val
E05015	We should stop making one-cent coins	in favor of	A one-cent coin costs about 60% more to produce than it is actually worth. 	val
E05021	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	in favor of	The use and promotion of civic technology contribute to a more inclusive, resident-focused urban co-governance model and build ecosystems rich in creativity and innovation, thanks to the diversity of users and perspectives that are at stake.	val
E05022	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	in favor of	These platforms are an opportunity to encourage the creation of public value and new forms of citizen participation, especially in urban areas. 	val
E05023	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	in favor of	In an era of weakening of political parties and distrust of the electorate for them, the future of democracy depends on the re-evaluation of the role of institutions and the direct involvement of citizens to investigate and understand the problems. 	val
E05024	We should promote collaborative civic technologies for enhancing citizen participation as an added value to collaborative urban processes	in favor of	Civic technologies can support the co-creation, co-production, and co-management of public services with citizens and the development of the urban commoning approach.	val
E05032	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making	in favor of	The European Parliament is in dire need of reform. It has become a circus, where the MEPs engage in wild ideological posturing without substance. The EP's function is to address the pressing needs of EU citizens, but it hasn't done that for ages. One possible solution could be to replace it with a legislative body that is made up of delegates from member state parliaments.	val
E05033	We should increase the role of national parliaments in EU decision-making	in favor of	Parliament and its left-liberal majority have begun to build an independent political-institutional character, based not on citizens’ needs, but on the main pillars of the progressive ideological agenda. This is how the EP has become a forum for discussion on gender and rule of law issues and a pro-migration EU institution. It is clear that the debate on the Future of Europe should also open the question of the future role of the European Parliament. 	val
E05096	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities	in favor of	The bicycle should be the main mode of transport for a majority of citizens because it is faster, it is easier, it is healthier, it is cheaper, it is more convenient, and it is eco-friendly.	val
E05097	We should make cycling and micromobility the primary modes of transport in all EU cities	in favor of	Having cycling and micromobility as primary modes also makes cities quieter, less congested, less polluted, safer, and simply more pleasant and liveable, particularly for children.	val
E05104	We should promote mental health	in favor of	A more relaxed approach to mental health would help society and individuals. It would be good for every person to be given psychotherapeutic advice once a year in order to be able to diagnose and treat mental disorders and illnesses at an early stage or even to prevent them.	val
E05105	We should promote mental health	in favor of	A psychological examination should be part of child screening, together with counseling to parents (e.g. dealing with children’s own concerns and fears, or increasing self-confidence among children and parents). It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognize them in the home and learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health. 	val
E05106	We should reduce subsidies for livestock and fisheries	in favor of	Subsidies for meat production and fishery not only have a negative impact on our environment - but they also destroy the economy in poorer countries in Africa! We really should find a way to stop these and get out of this vicious circle!	val
E05111	We should stop daylight saving time change	against	Having the same time in most of the Union’s countries helps reduce significant administrative difficulties: Let us imagine how difficult it would be to make goods and people travel from one country to another if the time (and therefore the timetables of the transportation) would change at each border.	val
E05112	We should stop daylight saving time change	against	Imposing the time change allows having more hours of light in summer, which gives an energy saving. I know that some studies say that savings would be minimal, but we must consider the growing European energy dependence on photovoltaics: We humans consume more electricity when we are awake, the photovoltaic gives a good availability of energy but only during the day and is difficult to store, to overlap the moment of energy availability given by photovoltaics (the hours of light) with the moment in which citizens have the most energy needs I think it can eventually save more energy in the future.	val
E05136	We should stop daylight saving time change	in favor of	 All countries should get back to their geographically correct time zone. It is in public often discussed as a matter of preference. But public health cannot be decided by inquiries about people's preferences. Several scientific and health organizations already published statements to speak up for at least permanent standard time and warn about the health implications of permanent or seasonal daylight saving time. And there is plenty more to list. Education suffers from Daylight Saving Time as much as the Economy, mainly because of productivity loss due to chronic sleep deprivation and disturbances and the increase in health costs.	val
E05141	We should stop daylight saving time change	in favor of	If the European Council listened to the results of the inquiry made by the European Commission. 'The EU was set to stop changing its clocks in 2021, but then came Brexit, the pandemic, and some messy international bureaucracy'.	val
E05142	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection	in favor of	A reflection on the future of Europe needs to identify and involve other actors alongside local and international institutions to fully deploy the founding values of our continent in addressing major global challenges. 	val
E05143	We should strengthen the public role of faith-based communities in environmental protection	in favor of	Through their emphasis on wisdom, social cohesion, and interrelatedness Faith-Based Organizations can show the potential to not only effectively mobilize people on the ground in responding to climate change but more importantly to motivate large sections of society to move from their deep seeded set of core values.	val
E05155	We should stop using GDP as the only indicator of development	in favor of	It is purely economic in nature and encourages excessive production and consumption.	val
E06009	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens	in favor of	The more language communication skills around the closer we can get in this complicated world we live in. The fact it is a popular language around the world but not really recognized in Europe should change. I fully endorse its recognition in Europe.	val
E06010	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens	in favor of	Esperanto is a common language of citizens from all countries of the EU. Esperanto encounters bring them together for contact and understanding. The authorities of the European Union are called upon to support this direct communication of the citizens. It is our free choice in which language we want to talk to each other - please recognize and promote it!  	val
E06012	We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East	in favor of	Those coming from there pretend to be refugees but are actually economic migrants. Slowly but surely these people are destroying Europe because they do not bring anything related to European values. Furthermore, they do not respect or accept European values. They bring crime, terror, and chaos. And after all, if there are no more Europeans in Europe, then what will happen to our beloved continent?	val
E06016	We should legalize non-violent drug use	in favor of	The 'War on Drugs' gifted to us by the USA is absolute rubbish. Sugar is more dangerous than Cannabis! How many people have died on 'legal highs'? FAR too many. The death toll from Cannabis use = 0. More lives have been destroyed by drug laws than the drugs themselves. Besides, Cannabis is an herb, not a drug. Many herbs have medicinal properties. If any becomes a health issue, that's how it needs to be addressed, as a health problem, not a crime!	val
E06029	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters	against	I disagree. National sovereignty is excellent for big and strong nations like China or USA. But if you're from a medium or small-sized country then 'national sovereignty' doesn't really exist. Simply because superpowers can force you to act in their interest. Strength brings sovereignty. EU sovereignty is much stronger than any nation in Europe. We need to focus on finding the right balance between national and European sovereignty.	val
E06030	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	in favor of	I fully agree that people should not be incarcerated for non-violent drug offenses. Drug addiction should be treated as a health issue. Drug addicts need help. Incarceration does not help them.	val
E06031	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	in favor of	We should legalize drugs as a means to promote justice, harm reduction, and religious freedom.  If we really want justice and human rights, this is absolutely essential.	val
E06032	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	in favor of	It's also important to remember that many people use these psychedelic medicines in the context of their own religious/spiritual practice, and therefore our draconic laws directly violate freedom of religion (and sovereignty over our own bodies). There's no way the EU should tolerate this if they really care about human rights.	val
E06033	We should legalize non-violent drug offenses	in favor of	Psychedelic medicines specifically have the potential to radically transform our mental health care. 	val
E06038	We should prevent the surveillance state	in favor of	Excessive surveillance preemptively assumes everyone is a potential criminal and definitely undermines the basic human right of autonomy and self-determination. 	val
E06039	We should prevent the surveillance state	in favor of	The number of video surveillance and control and intervention rights for public authorities is steadily increasing (at least according to my subjective feeling). This puts our free way of life at risk. A person who feels monitored will never really act freely. 	val
E06040	We should prevent the surveillance state	in favor of	I am not prepared to continue to restrict my freedom on a permanent basis due to the actions of a minority of offenders, as a citizen who is not a victim. The policy has to find a better balance here. 	val
E06046	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI	in favor of	In order to be able to fight cross-border crime, Europol should have the same jurisdiction as the FBI in the US. It should focus on domestic EU cross-border crime fighting. It should have the autonomy to act without the intervention of local or national political influence.	val
E06047	We should recognize Esperanto as one of the cultural languages of EU citizens	in favor of	Our local Esperanto group in Tuebingen is also in constant contact with the Esperanto groups of Strasburg and Bilbao because we are Esperanto twin towns. And there are more of these twin towns in Europe and across the world. For example, Rome and Paris are Esperanto's twin towns. This is a very concrete example of a culture of international exchange within the Esperanto community. In fact, this kind of intercultural exchange is fundamental to the culture of Esperanto.	val
E06048	We should stop the mass migration from Africa and the Middle East	in favor of	Illegal mass migration is a tragedy. Those who organize and direct mass migration are guilty of a crime against Humanity. Soros and Lukashenka are prime examples of such criminals. 	val
E06049	We should legalize non-violent drug use	in favor of	I fully agree that the recreational drugs that cause the least harm should be legalized. It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.	val
E06053	We should limit population growth in overcrowded regions	against	Limiting freedom of movement does not seem like a good idea to me. I think what you are experiencing is bad local management, with urban planning laws fast growth and traffic issues can be fixed and avoided altogether.	val
E06054	We should legalize non-violent drug use	in favor of	European institutions should take factual studies of the relative harm of different drugs into account. A UK study has shown that drugs such as cannabis and many hallucinogenic drugs are far less harmful than alcohol. The study in question was conducted by David J Nutt, Leslie A King, Lawrence D Phillips, on behalf of the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs	val
E06060	We should reform Europol towards a European FBI	against	I think Europol should stay an association of regular National Police Departments and not be turned into anything else. However, I do support the creation of a European Criminal Investigations Office that will have full jurisdiction in the EU to investigate kidnappings and missing persons, cross-border and organized crime, terrorism threats, and digital crimes, and apprehend fugitives and suspects. 	val
E06067	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life	in favor of	The traditional family is the cornerstone of European civilization. 	val
E06068	We should put the accent on traditional values and on preserving family life	in favor of	The family is people's foundation and it rests on it all their lives and work, and this needs to be valued.	val
E06070	We should reduce disinformation about the migrant crisis through bans and fines	against	Typical pro-migration attempt to censor negative opinions.  Lukashenka launched a hybrid attack on the EU when he organized and directed mass migration to Europe's borders. George Soros and his NGOs did the exact same thing. When it is they who organize and direct mass migration they are also engaged in a hybrid assault on Europe.  The organization of migration is a crime against humanity. Gangsters like Lukashenka and Soros should be held accountable! 	val
E06083	We should stop Brussels from imposing ideologies, concrete policies to develop in exchange for financial aid, interference in agricultural production or legislating in judicial matters	against	National identities are important and have to be preserved, but nowadays these are not the key to the success. We need to be united, aligned, and, above all, independent from any extra-EU hegemon!	val
E07007	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness	in favor of	In order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.	val
E07008	We should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage	against	This attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.	val
E07010	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants	in favor of	Refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course. When it comes to crimes, people are simply no longer worthy of protection and cannot be expelled because their actions show us that they neither accept nor respect our rules.	val
E07011	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants	against	All people have the same right to be here. Nobody is unjustified. Refugees/migrants are not to be expelled, certainly not immediately, but to be included in the employment problems and economic situation.	val
E07012	We should protect the EU borders and stop migration	in favor of	Protecting the EU's external borders and guaranteeing that no one can enter the Schengen free movement zone who does not have the right to do so is a primary condition for security in Budapest, Berlin, Lyon, or anywhere in Europe.	val
E07013	We should strengthen Frontex and control immigration	against	Before Frontex is strengthened, Frontex's human rights violations must first be stopped.	val
E07015	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants	against	Everyone has the right to be wrong sometimes. Everyone (immigrants and Europeans) should behave well, but I think it depends a lot on the level of inclusion of these people.  If we manage to be a welcoming continent, the people who come will thank us by being part of society.	val
E07023	We should remove illegal immigrants.	in favor of	EU must take action. Help those in need, but only those who respect legal boundaries. Mutual respect is a cornerstone in this subject where we must set limits to protect Europe. 	val
E07026	We should protect the European border	in favor of	Only together and with  Frontex we ensure the management of EU borders. Migrants from Africa and Asia will arrive in increasing numbers in the coming years.	val
E07028	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is shortsighted. We need to selectively pick people who can and are willing to contribute to the greater good like Australia and Canada and do prescreening instead of banning everyone.  	val
E07029	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration to EU from non-European or non-first-world countries will lead to an even more competitive advantage for the USA and other countries as our population is shrinking rapidly.  	val

E07031	We should protect the European border.	in favor of	Frontex is the way to protect the European border. It should completely take over every border, land, sea, and air. Otherwise, it will just take over all the good personnel of a member state, causing even more problems at the border.	val
E07066	We should support Frontex.	in favor of	Frontex is a key agency and is called to play a crucial role in the coming years. Yet, it lacks the necessary political support it deserves to carry out its mission. 	val
E07067	We should support Frontex.	in favor of	 The EU needs a robust Frontex Agency with the caveat that Frontex missions must report to the member states on whose territories they operate.	val
E07072	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	in favor of	We would have to change asylum rules. Illegal immigrants will claim asylum after entering the country to attempt to make their entry legal. It then becomes a massive pain to deport them. Illegal entries must result in an automatic rejection of asylum claims.	val
E07088	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	in favor of	We need single and selective migration rules. It is very challenging for Europe to protect its border without harming refugees or financial migrants fleeing their countries, and it cannot be efficient without unified and powerful border security (Frontex). 	val
E07089	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non first-world countries 	in favor of	Saying no to any migration is just stupid and irrealistic.	val
E07093	We should stop integration.	in favor of	This is genuinely the most humane proposal. If Europeans are 'privileged' we should use that to help foreign nations. Instead, our elites do the opposite, instigate problems in other nations (Syria, Libya, etc.), and then indigenous Europeans get replaced in our own homelands because we're 'privileged'.	val
E07104	We should punish illegal immigrants and only accept legal immigrants.	in favor of	Countries that send immigrants illegally are not trustable and should get blacklisted for traveling toward Europe or economically.	val
E07112	We should protect the European border	in favor of	Frontex deserves much more political support, especially from the European Commission. It is already playing an important role to manage the border and is called to play a crucial one in the coming years. 	val

E07117	We should stop immigration.	in favor of	The official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. This is what the EU is doing to its own member states by allowing immigration into Europe from the Middle East and Africa.  Therefore, I can only conclude that EU bureaucrats hate native Europeans.	val
E07124	We should not have any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries 	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is definitely not the way to go! That’s not how human societies should work!  What we need is a proper policy of integration and welcoming of refugees, that is both fair and respectful of human rights	val
E07144	We should speak about the ongoing genocide in China.	in favor of	I am concerned about the source of some cotton, which is produced in Chinese detention camps. A unified EU mark of ethical & environmental principles would be a nice thing to have when deciding what to buy.	val

E07256	We should promote European values and secure a Global Transition to CO2 Neutrality	against	I oppose tying investment to ideological convictions. Generally, there has been way too much ideology in European matters, and conflicts that derive from a conflict of worldviews within Europe have already contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU this conference hopes to address. Specifically, when it comes to trade, all that should matter are our financial, economic, and strategic interests. Let us leave ideology to that very expensive talking shop: the European Parliament. 	val
E08006	We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users	in favor of	A good idea to end online trolls and haters. Easy to set up, it is a very good short-term solution, but fake news, unfortunately, escapes this regulation. So there is a need for other measures to attack the algorithms of the social networks themselves.	val
E08007	We should introduce digital identity authentication on social media that has more than 100,000 users	in favor of	Anonymity is at least as much as important as Identity.  Today it is very easy to be anonymous, but hard to prove the identity of opinion and establish a public web of trust.  Anonymity enables powerful identities to control the messages, and therefore the identity-seeking masses. 	val
E08010	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine are by far the most important neighbors of the EU. A good relationship with all three is very desirable for the EU. For that, we would have to be willing to understand their history better.	val
E08011	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	The Russian Federation is our neighbor. We share common historic and cultural ties with them. Today the EU confronts Russia with sanctions. An understandable reaction to its actions in Ukraine and failing democracy. Let us not forget actions done by others (US intervention in Iraq, the Chinese in Tibet and their treatment of minorities, etc.). Yet we close our eyes.	val
E08012	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	Russia is troublesome with its own agenda and unconventional methods. Perhaps due to a heritage of a system, that is no longer the norm today. Remember, they fought next to us and Russians merit our hand reaching out to them. A policy change to show empathy, foster closer economic ties, and build on bilateral projects and partnerships in various cultural, scientific, trade, or economic programs. 	val
E08013	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	Including Russia in our sphere of friendship would allow the EU to discuss certain values from within and coax them toward democracy and change. Economic partnerships can act as leverage. Friendly ties, in time, will bring common views to prevail. 	val
E08014	We should shift the EU policy toward the Russian Federation	in favor of	Pushing Russia to the wall will have adverse effects by creating a Russian-Chinese axe, detrimental to the EU. Closer economic ties allow job prospects on both sides and improve scientific research and discoveries that remain within the European continent. A partnership where both sides share and benefit from technological domains (aerospace, AI, energy, fusion, bio-chemicals, etc.).	val

If a country wants to join the EU and meets the conditions for joining, the decision to join is solely between the candidate country and the EU.	val
E08025	We should strengthen our ties with Ukraine and prepare for its membership in the EU	in favor of	When you see young Ukrainians dying for the EU and its values during Euromaidan, you have no choice but to accept that Ukraine has chosen Europe. If people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. We must deepen our relations with Ukraine and prepare to make it a candidate for membership. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia.	val

E02119	We should allocate 3% of GDP for research and innovation by 2035	in favor of	EU is the house of peace but without knowledge and without research, peace is in danger.	test
E02120	We should ban wild animals in circuses	in favor of	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!	test

E03002	We should ban wild animals in circuses	in favor of	It's about time we stop using animals for entertainment purposes!	test
E03021	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	against	Not a good idea. We already have a system that runs refugee camps in other countries, the UNHCR. Why reinvent the wheel? How would EU camps be any different from UN camps?	test
E03022	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	against	If Europe is going to have concentration camps again, they should be in Europe, in plain sight, for everyone to see.	test
E03023	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	against	We can't outsource our problems to third world countries.	test
E03024	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	against	Setting up inhumane camps by bribing local warlords is not the right way.	test
E03034	We should implement a climate score for products	in favor of	In addition to production and shipping, the score should also reflect the impact of the product's disposal. For example if the product requires to apply many different (toxic) chemicals for recycling, this should result in a worse score. 	test
E03035	We should implement a climate score for products	in favor of	Yes, but the problem is: Just because a product can be recycled, it does not mean that it always will be recycled. Let's assume that there would be a really climate friendly way to recycle batteries. Still people could throw those into landfills. How does the score deal with this?	test
E03036	We should build more nuclear power plants	against	Where do you think should be stored nuclear/radioactive waste please? Stored in glaciers will be problem (with melting etc.).	test
E03043	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	in favor of	Agree. If the asylum seekers don't have to cross the Mediterranean to apply for it less of them will die trying and less human trafficking will take place.	test
E03044	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	in favor of	Agree. Whoever is rejected won't be in the country and eat up resources that could be used to process others.	test
E03056	We should abolish low emission zones that prevent old cars from entering	against	I think every region or city has the right to protect the citizens & the environment. If they all have to wait till the whole European Union is following & all existing cars which have been produced & sold under different conditions naturally fade out, they have no chance. 	test
E03062	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	I highly support this. As Jonathan Foer puts it in his book 'We are the weather': Changing our diet will not suffice to save the planet, but we won't save it unless we eat differently.	test
E03075	We should abolish nuclear energy only after we abolished fossil energy	against	Nuclear energy is not safe and it is not green because of radioactive waste. It is only transitional. We have good conditions for sustainable green energy (solar, wind, hydro, bio-methane and their combinations).	test
E03083	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	against	I understand your point and its importance, but as long as I have fangs in my mouth I will want to eat meat (like most people). You'd be better off suggesting more research into food printers. 	test
E03084	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	It's difficult to find a green idea I would not endorse however, promoting a plant-based lifestyle is the single most effective way any individual can make an instantaneous, meaningful and long-lasting impact.	test
E03085	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	A plant-based lifestyle does not demand a social standing, greater income or innate ability. It only requires a person's higher capacity to be compassionate, respectful and most of all dedicated to our environment's needs. Who wouldn't want such qualities to become our society's norm?	test
E03086	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	Even if you believe you are unable to follow a plant-based lifestyle you must appreciate the effectiveness and dedication to the environment of those individuals who do.	test
E03087	We should extract our food from plant rather than animal sources	in favor of	There is no reason other than egotism to be against such a proposal.	test
E04003	We should have migrant camps in the countries that migrants come from	in favor of	Good idea. These camps can be managed by the UN. The EU can send illegal immigrants to these camps. So they will not be on EU soil. From the camps they still can apply for asylum.	test
E04004	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.	in favor of	Europe has signed the UN charta on human rights. Also, Europe has the resources to design a fair and safe migration system so that the death of refugees in the Mediterranean sea stops.	test
E04005	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.	against	Immigrants from non-European countries are also growing old.  	test
E04006	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.	against	Europe should concern itself with its own existence and culture. Not the center of diversity and exclusivity experiments.	test
E04007	We should get migration from Asia, and South East Asia because Europe is too old.	against	Integrating an immigrant into the EU is costly.	test
E04009	We should have legal migration channels.	in favor of	We do need migrants for example to harvest our fruits and vegetables or take care of our elder and children. 	test
E04010	We should have legal migration channels.	in favor of	It is a human right to change the country you live in and to live in safe conditions.	test
E04011	We should have legal migration channels.	in favor of	The anti-immigration politics of the European Union make no sense and are against human rights. 	test
E04017	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.	in favor of	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially article 14, states: 'Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.'	test
E04018	We should create a migration system that reflects European values.	against	Living in Europe is not a human right. Illegal migrants are willing to break a law and risk their lives (and the lives of their families), while unable to undergo the proper legal and established process and paperwork.	test
E04055	We should have legal migration channels.	against	If countries, where migrants want to go, would spend the money on their own they would be rich and economies would run like hell. 	test
E04056	We should have legal migration channels.	against	Immigrants should try on their own to improve the system in their homelands.	test
E04057	We should have legal migration channels.	against	Immigrants cannot work because they don't speak the required language.	test
E04058	We should end illegal pushbacks.	against	Pushbacks are not per se illegal. On the contrary, if someone tries to enter from a safe third country into the EU, there is no reason why the EU should grant an asylum procedure to that person, knowing well that someone who enter the EU once, will never leave, even if the asylum claim will be processed with a negative result. 	test
E04059	We should end illegal pushbacks.	against	Pushbacks should be a core part of an effective border protection mechanism of the EU.	test
E04060	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.	in favor of	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.	test
E04061	We should have legal and accessible migration routes instead of mass deaths in the Mediterranean.	in favor of	We have the universal declaration of human rights, which says that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person.	test
E04065	We should end illegal pushbacks.	in favor of	The EU allegedly values human rights, and so should respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pushbacks are clearly a violation of basic human rights.	test
E04068	We should end mass migration together.	in favor of	Mass migration is a phenomenon that causes damage to nations: target countries and source countries.	test
E04069	We should end mass migration together.	in favor of	Mass migration hurts the migrants themselves immensely. 	test
E04073	We should end illegal pushbacks!	against	We should develop adequate border protection. The border guards should be given the legal and practical means to carry out their duty. 	test
E04074	We should end illegal pushbacks!	against	The human rights regulations should be adapted. They were written half a century ago when we did not have mass migration. 	test
E04093	We should be realistic wrt. migration.	in favor of	It has been proven in many studies,  that immigrants will not cost Europe money but enrich our economy, as well as in so many cultural ways. It will not cost Europe more than the profit they ultimately contribute	test
E04094	We should be realistic wrt. migration.	in favor of	Refugees want to find a safe place in order to live. People are HUMAN.	test
E04095	We should be realistic wrt. migration.	in favor of	I am ashamed that I am European right now. We are keeping refugees behind walls and on islands like savages. They don't want to run from their home country. Who are we ok to deny them the right to exist?	test
E04116	We should be aware of migration due to climate change	in favor of	There are no laws protecting climate refugees nowadays. They are facing all kinds of abuse, violence, and aggression, even from officials at the borders!  	test
E04117	We should be aware of migration due to climate change	in favor of	There are already 84 million climate refugees in the world and this number is growing every single day! Nobody is protected and tomorrow can become one of them.  We need to create new laws protecting climate refugees and value human life as the highest value. 	test
E04135	We should adopt a single migration policy.	in favor of	This single migration policy should include that:  Brussels (EU) handles the paperwork and logistics. Including, detention, and deportation of illegal immigrants. 	test
E04136	We should adopt a single migration policy.	in favor of	This single migration policy should include that: Members decide about the admission of the migrant. The conditions of the visa. Members will also pay for the cost of immigration/integration.	test
E04150	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work. 	test
E04159	We should adopt a single migration policy.	in favor of	Europeans should retain control of our homeland, just as everyone else should theirs.	test
E05006	We should have equal and fair taxation across the EU member states	against	'Fair' taxation is a vague concept. Taxes are complex and countries want to avoid double taxation.  Countries should be able to set their own taxes in a way that matches their spending and the needs of their citizens. I am against global taxes and against double taxation.	test
E05007	We should further develop robotization	in favor of	The technology-enabled economy of abundance without human exploitation you can endorse it. We should not hamper automation, instead, we should rethink morals about work. Let the robots do all the bad jobs and let human beings be free to pursue a creative and meaningful life	test
E05008	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union	in favor of	It appears that the European Union remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.	test
E05009	We should enforce a minimal corporate tax within the entire European Union	in favor of	Instead of stopping the evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense, and scientific research.  This built up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic.  These poor political choices also led to social unrest and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.	test
E05038	We should abolish the European Council	against	It would be a better idea to abolish the European Parliament. It has become an ideological Kabuki Theatre. The Commission should be entirely under the control of the sovereign member states, of course, who remain the masters of the treaties.	test
E05041	We should develop civic education and media literacy to empower citizens against disinformation	against	Absolutely all such attempts merely lead to new types of misinformation. People get excited and carried away. They might go into the project with a clear conscience hoping to 'defend the truth' but end up spreading fake news and defending the point of view they hold. As Churchill said, 'the truth is so important that it has to be protected by a bodyguard of lies.'  The good news is that people are adjusting to the new reality of ever-growing, all-pervasive misinformation by evolving a bullshit detector.	test
E05057	We should abolish the European Council	in favor of	Nowadays the voice of the EU in foreign policy and security is weak because any EU-MS can veto any decision in the EU Council. We have seen this many times when the EU-MS have tried to find a common stance on foreign policy issues but one has been able to deter the will of all the other countries. This is not a democratic way.   The EU Council should be only an advisory group to EU Parliament, and the decisions should be made in the EU Parliament with a majority vote principle because they are directly responsible to the citizens of the EU through a truly European election. 	test
E05058	We should abolish the European Council	in favor of	Let us make the EU a fully-fledged democracy. In the classic three powers of democracy (legislation, executive and judicial) there is no place for an institution like the European Council. All legislative power should go to parliament — the executive power should only go to the Commission. The European Council is still too much-misused by the larger member states of Germany and France to push through their agenda.	test
E05065	We should abolish unanimity voting	in favor of	Veto rights for individual member states run the risk of blocking social progress.	test
E05075	We should abolish unanimity voting	against	The veto is rarely used, but when it is, it is almost always thoroughly justified. No, we must preserve the member state veto.	test
E05077	We should abolish unanimity voting	in favor of	Requiring unanimity to pass legislation over certain topics is a terrible idea because it gives the opportunity to a single country to block a reform because they think they could get a better deal, meaning it's impossible to find compromises, as a country could always veto the legislation if they don't get exactly what they want. This makes the EU slow and hard to reform.	test
E05078	We should abolish unanimity voting	in favor of	Qualified voting is enough, if the need arises, to ‘protect’ the interests, preferences, and ideals of all Member-States. Unanimity leads to blackmail and/or deleterious impasses, and stalemates. We all have regrettable situations. Never again.	test
E05086	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees	in favor of	In Germany, a lot of company cars are not for business use but are offered to employees as incentives in order to use tax benefits and avoid the cost of payments to the social security system (in particular in the financial sector). This creates an incentive to buy heavyweight cars (be it combustion or electric automobiles). Also, e-vehicles consume rare resources for batteries like lithium and water increasing their weight. Therefore tax / social security benefits should only refer to the strict use of business reasons and not for cost avoidance to the disadvantage of the social security or tax system. Finally, this money should be invested in public infrastructure and public transport. 	test
E05091	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU	against	This is a ridiculous proposition. No one is forcing you to take an unpaid internship. If companies are forced to pay for interns many just won't take any, which is a missed opportunity for people to learn skills. This is also difficult to regulate - will you ban voluntary work too? If not, what's the legal difference? Why should we not have the freedom to work as free interns for a company if we want to? How is this a good idea? This is just a restriction of freedom of choice.	test
E05092	We should create a pan-European train company	in favor of	I think the EU should be in charge of this project, instead of national governments trying to link it up and everything should be financed with the EU budget.	test
E05093	We should create a pan-European train company	in favor of	A common train network would be a strong alternative to air- and even the car-travel if it is done properly with the right services and prices. For freight, this would significantly reduce truck distances and thus significantly reduce pollution. 	test
E05095	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry	in favor of	Today we live in a system where our public healthcare system is organized on a for-profit healthcare system, where we develop knowledge through taxpayer institutions and then let companies patent this knowledge for profit this has to change, we shouldn't let the greed of capitalists extort us, the EU should work to DISMANTLE all patents and make healthcare issues for all. The big pharma companies just drive up the price and charge prices, the EU shouldn't be just that to protect the interest of these companies like they do now.	test
E05100	We should develop European space mining to reduce pressure on Earth's ecosystems	against	Space mining may be neat science fiction, but I doubt it could ever become a commercially feasible activity. Aside from the environmental impact of launching vehicles into space, moving the mined materials to Earth would pose its own challenges. Entry into the atmosphere and arrival on Earth is dangerous. Having thousands of tons of mined matter go through this process seems destined to end up with frequent disasters.	test
E05103	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU	in favor of	Members should adopt measures to end unpaid Internships causes they are a form of exploitation of young people.	test
E05109	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU	in favor of	This way all EU countries have access to a single database which will reduce paperwork and registration and provide immediate and informed service without the risk of complications, especially in regard to medical history. 	test
E05110	We should embrace the future of GMO	against	We have the possibility to choose between life and death. Life is for me 'Green up to cool down'. Death is for me allowing drought, extreme rain, and water scarcity to rule our lives and use big tech to somehow survive.	test
E05114	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU	in favor of	The EU Database should be made accessible for health studies and prevention in order to establish a European Basic Health care industry to overcome future pandemics.	test
E05117	We should ban domestic air traffic	against	Instead of banning anything, we should create better alternatives. When the high-speed rail line (320 km/h) between Strasbourg and Paris was opened, the number of flights between Stuttgart and Paris dropped dramatically, due to decreasing demand.	test
E05123	We should decriminalize drug use	in favor of	We can't allow our prisons to be filled with curious kids and desperate people. The use of drugs most often happens within safe quantities or as acts of despair caused by stress. We must ensure that victims of drug abuse be helped and integrated back into society, and not treat them as criminals. This can also free up law enforcement resources for more important offenses.	test
E05128	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU	against	Young people may choose not to be exploited. My main problem with unpaid internships is that young people choose them because there are not enough entry-level paid jobs out there. Banning the practice will not change the underlying problem one bit. Reforms in the economy and education are the answer to your grievance, but those may not be solved by brute government force.	test
E05132	We should ban storing nuclear waste within Europe’s territory	against	Nuclear waste can very certainly be buried in Europe. It might even be a pretty good place to do so! There is a lot of rock where you are completely safe from radiation on the outside and it is not geologically active at all!  Rather than putting it on an island where the inevitable break will distribute into the ocean, rain water, and around the entire world.  Radioactive rain - cool ;-) 	test
E05134	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees	in favor of	I would suggest a general sustainability tax for all products, services & actions where cars could be taxed according to their environmental impact both concerning GHG emissions and local air pollution. Additionally, companies could lose tax benefits, if they use cars with big combustion engines. They could have tax reductions on electric vehicles or public transport tickets. 	test
E05135	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees	in favor of	If an employee receives part of his salary in the form of car and petrol, he will naturally use it more than he would otherwise, be less inclined to explore alternative ways of transport and opt for a bigger more polluting vehicle than what he really needs.	test
E05137	We should embrace the future of GMO	in favor of	The main thing that needs to be done is educating people. Most people imagine dangerous poisonous chemicals when they hear the words GMO, which is far from the truth. The truth is, as you said, everything we eat (both plants and animals) was genetically modified, just with a slower, manual process. Being against GMOs is like being against a tractor. It's just a tool to speed up what manually takes hundreds of years.	test
E05138	We should embrace the future of GMO	in favor of	We have the option to cure hunger in many places, increase the nutritional value of food, increase yields of manufacturing crops like cotton, and make plants resistant to emerging dangers of climatic change and globalization like predatory fungi or insects that harm crops or by making crops resistant to drought and heat waves. It’s sad to see that it has the rest of the world is moving forward, we in Europe have been misled behind in this respect.	test
E05144	We should ban unpaid internships in the EU	against	I am for the ban on internships that do not provide additional education and skills building, which are low-level jobs with no growth prospects. Such internships should be paid definitely. But I am against the ban on unpaid internships which provide other benefits - continuing education, mentoring, experience, skills building, upon which the highly paid job can be acquired in the future. High-quality unpaid internships have an impact on inequality - currently, they put poor people at disadvantage, and hence they are a factor in sustaining the poverty trap.	test
E05147	We should implement a chipped medical card as a medical ID shared across the EU	against	No, just no. You have no right to demand that people put their entire medical history on a card readable by all countries. I would not put mine willingly.  Now a common health card for the EU, especially for insurance purposes and very important medical info (implants, transplants, severe allergies, blood type) yes. This makes sense, it does not infringe on privacy and everyone will agree to such a card. The moment you want a diagnosis and other stuff, that's where you are way off. You do know there are medical data centers and archives for this stuff? Hospitals can access this. But this is on a whole other level and should not be via card and not like this.	test
E05149	We should forbid authorities to give tax advantages, or any kind of incentives, to companies providing expensive and powerful company cars to their employees	against	How would you know how many cases where companies and employees rely on their cars? How would you differentiate between needs and luxury?	test
E05150	We should deprivatize the healthcare industry	against	I think we should decouple for-profit medicine from social issues. For-profit medicine is a good thing because it enables the most recent emergence of anti-aging/rejuvenation therapies (e.g. Science-intensive healthy longevity technologies: development and access), state governed health system currently is not pursuing such efforts, even more, currently there are no clinical tests allowed on therapies that target just aging, that is not associated with the specific aging-related disease. So, it should be laudable that businesses are doing this. 	test
E05151	We should embrace the future of GMO	against	Instead of GMOs, we could refocus on plant breeding - less risky than GMOs and less harmful to nature.  Also, I consider the statement: 'Humanity has been consuming genetically modified food for thousands of years.' misleading on purpose.  Genetically modified e.g. 500 years ago by whom? The soft way how to sell GMOs, which were created only in the few last decades (as far as it is known).	test
E05152	We should embrace the future of GMO	against	I am not completely against the use of GMOs in general, however, I am against the use of GMOs in the way they have been used until now. Proprietary patented seeds, leading to the increased power of the aggro lobby (and control of the whole food system); Seeds that cannot be reproduced by the farmer himself (posing health risks if done so); Seeds degrading soil and harming the environment due increased (intended) use of herbicides; Often oversold yield benefits, which might actually be lower compared to crops grown with agroecological principles. If we can make GMO seeds that will lead to decreased environmental impact (which is often the opposite of what is often happening now), seeds that will not put smaller farmers at disadvantage (e.g. forcing them to buy new seeds every year), then sure. But not right now.	test
E05153	We should abolish the EU COVID digital certificate	in favor of	Unfortunately, vaccination has shown that it is unable to curb the contagion and therefore the spread of COVID-19. As a result, the EU COVID digital certificate is not able to guarantee the safety for which it was designed, demonstrating that it is primarily a tool of discrimination without real usefulness in containing contagion	test
E06001	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity. 	in favor of	Eurocrats must learn to act within the space afforded them by the European Treaties. Their grandstanding and theatrics are counterproductive	test
E06002	We should enforce the rule of law, promoting respect for human rights without linking them to any alleged “European” identity. 	in favor of	To begin with, stop using the labels “Europe” and “European” to name the EU institutions and initiatives. Do not forget that there are parts of the EU that are not part of Europe (the Spanish territories of the Canary Islands and the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, for example, belong to Africa from a geographical point of view); also, that there are parts of Europe that do not belong to Europe (the UK and Switzerland, to name only two); the EU and Europe are not synonyms: Cyprus is a member state of the EU, but 'if' geographically it is Europe, so must be Turkey.	test
E06021	We should abolish limitation periods for sexual offenses	in favor of	Sexual offences and other serious crimes giving rise to psychological trauma must be excluded from limitation periods, as it is often impossible for victims to remember, let alone report, within the limitation period.	test
E06034	We should develop a uniform conception of the rule of law	against	The rule of law varies from country to country, due to the fact that the concept developed in each country under the influence of local traditions. It's impossible, and superfluous to develop a uniform, EU-standard conception of the rule of law. 	test
E06035	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech	against	'War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength'... and now censorship is free speech.	test
E06037	We should end discrimination between individuals based on gender	against	We have made huge strides in ending sex-based discrimination in Europe. I think we can say that - but for a few details - this issue has been resolved.  'Gender' is a political concept made out of whole cloth. One is certainly free to imagine oneself to be a pink unicorn, but in the eyes of the law and society, he or she remains a man or a woman.	test
E06051	We should fight racism in the EU	against	Racism is not a major problem in Europe. We need none of this Critical Race Theory nonsense.	test
E06066	We should create a common constitution	against	The EU is not a country, but a free association of sovereign member states. Associations don't have constitutions. We have the perfectly fine EU Treaties as the foundational documents of the EU. They must be followed to the letter. 	test
E06072	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU	in favor of	We need to protect citizen sovereignty against bad players (be it the state, private entities, or other individuals). 	test
E06073	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU	in favor of	Facial recognition can and will be used against each of us by governments and corporations, based on who we are and what we look like. It will create societies of fear, anxiety, and suspicion.	test
E06074	We should ban biometric mass surveillance in the EU	in favor of	Evidence shows that uses of biometric mass surveillance in Member States and by EU agencies have resulted in violations of EU data protection law, and unduly restricted people‘s rights including their privacy, right to free speech, right to protest, and not to be discriminated against. 	test
E06080	We should abolish Chatcontrol	in favor of	Yes, child abuse is a terrible crime, but there must be another way, which won't introduce surveillance of all. This surveillance would affect all people and violate their rights to privacy. It could (and probably would) end up abused by hackers, totalitarian regimes, etc. for censorship of free speech.  There is no such thing as a backdoor only for the good guys.	test
E06081	We should abolish Chatcontrol	in favor of	Chatcontrol is a harmful norm: it violates the secrecy of correspondence, increases the indiscriminate and unreasonable surveillance of citizens, allows governments and providers to experiment with tools that can be used for worrying purposes	test
E06082	We should abolish Chatcontrol	in favor of	Chatcontrol harms minors as well — it shifts attention to risks online, but abuses occur mainly offline: in families living in poverty and degradation; in the structures that should help them; in EU-funded refugee camps, or in countries with which we have diplomatic relations. 	test
E06090	We should distinguish freedom of opinion from hate speech	against	Who gets to decide what is 'hate speech'? Should the promotion of feminism be considered hate speech against men, or is only hate speech when you don't agree with someone?	test
E06096	We should choose or create a new European (or global) auxiliary language	in favor of	Europe should choose a common language.  This can be the most spoken language by mother tongue, the most spoken language in Europe, or an international auxiliary language. The language most spoken mother tongue in Europe is probably German. The most spoken language in Europe is probably English. An international auxiliary language can be Esperanto. This then is a language that most people in Europe have to learn. Does the question remain what language will be spoken we talk with people outside of Europe? Will this be Esperanto or English? Next to that, I have the impression that English is basically also an international auxiliary language. 	test
E07024	We should have no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	against	Halting all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is not how human societies work. 	test

G01021	The rot starts at the top.	in favor of	At the beginning of the crisis Trump acted as if he could wish the coronavirus away, and after an interval when he at least pretended to take it seriously, his administration has resumed a posture of blithe denial.	nyt
G01022	An epidemic that was once concentrated in blue states is increasingly raging in red ones.	in favor of	Now, as New York gingerly reopens, Arizona has become a hot spot — which isn’t stopping Trump from holding a rally at a Phoenix megachurch on Tuesday. Cases are also soaring in Texas, Florida and several other states.	nyt
G01023	When coronavirus cases started exploding on the East Coast in March, there were devastating failures by Democratic leaders.	in favor of	New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, not only forced nursing homes to take back residents who’d been hospitalized for the coronavirus, he barred them from testing the residents to see if they were still infected.	nyt
G01024	Given how Cuomo’s errors contributed to New York’s catastrophe, it’s hard to say how much credit he deserves for eventually rising to the occasion.	against	Still, by the time New York’s cases got to where Arizona’s are now, he at least understood that the state faced calamity and imposed the lockdown that helped bring it back from the abyss.	nyt
G01025	The paranoia and resentment that have long been part of the culture of the modern right are now directed at those warning about the ongoing dangers of the pandemic.	in favor of	Across the country, public health workers have faced death threats, harassment and armed protesters at their homes.	nyt
G01026	There are many knowable parameters in the equation:	in favor of	your health; the prevalence of cases where you live; the safety precautions being taken any place you want to visit. But the final answer may depend on your individual risk tolerance for exposure to infectious disease.	nyt
G01027	So our fear is enormous, and our risk tolerance for exposure is just about zero.	in favor of	In a world of effective antibiotics and antivirals and other treatments, deaths or even serious illnesses from infectious disease seem nearly incomprehensible.	nyt
G01028	I hear too many people saying “I’m not going back to life until there’s a vaccine” — as if that will immediately eliminate the risk. It won’t.	in favor of	Even if one of the current vaccine candidates works, it could be quite a while before it’s widely distributed. And to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it has to protect only half of the people who take it from infection.	nyt
G01029	So if we want to get out of our bunkers, we all need to take stock of our risk tolerance.	in favor of	For the foreseeable future we will be living in a world with some level of coronavirus out there.	nyt
G01030	Some, of course, never got to make this decision.	in favor of	Risk tolerance is about duty and conscience but very often it’s also about how much you need a paycheck.	nyt
G01031	Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced.	in favor of	Now many physicians I know in Covid-19 hot spots say they actually feel safest in the hospital, where procedures like masking and sanitizing are assiduously followed. (Hell hath no fury like a surgeon who witnesses a medical student touch a sterile surface with an unsterile hand.) In contrast, on the sidewalk, the coronavirus could be roaming free if people aren’t wearing masks.	nyt
G01032	Which is why masking should be mandated and enforced.	in favor of	It’s not just about your individual risk tolerance, but about keeping everyone safe	nyt
G01033	I do not blame teachers for being unwilling to return to school in places where administrators and local officials have been in denial about Covid-19 or have been unwilling or unable to do this preparatory work.	against	But once schools have put in place appropriate science-based steps, most teachers (those not in high-risk groups) should return to their jobs.	nyt
G01034	I am, in theory, the last person who should ever do any medical trial at all, and, on the way up to the hospital, this thought occurred to me numerous times.	in favor of	As someone who suffers from pretty significant anxiety about my health	nyt
G01035	Smart people are worried about this vaccine.	in favor of	I texted one of my friends, an extremely smart, Ivy League-educated doctor. He responded with reservations about taking the vaccine at such an early stage. He said he himself wouldn’t. He was not the first person to express this sentiment. Many people around me told me I was nuts for doing this. They look at me in bewilderment. These people weren’t anti-vaxxers; they don’t belong to dubious Facebook groups. They are educated, often left-leaning — people who shouldn’t, theoretically, have vaccine hesitancy.	nyt
G01036	As President Trump pushes for the quick rollout, public trust is eroding.	in favor of	Only 21 percent of Americans surveyed in a CBS poll this month said they would get the vaccine as soon as possible if one was offered at no cost.	nyt
G01037	It’s not hard to see where this is heading: a nightmare in which we have a vaccine yet mistrust of the government is so great that people won’t take it.	in favor of	Three in four Democrats say if a vaccine were to become available this year, their first thought would be that it was rushed without enough testing, CBS reported.	nyt
G01038	if Americans take the chance and stick their arms out for science. Ask not what your country can do for you but what vaccine trial you can enroll in.	in favor of	Normal will come back a lot faster	nyt
G01039	A catastrophic sequence of decisions has blocked states from responding to the pandemic.	in favor of	Alongside growing controversy over judicial nominations, court reform and Covid-19 policies, American law is in the midst of a little-noticed paradigm shift in courts’ treatment of public health measures. The Republican Party’s campaign to take over the federal and state courts is quietly upending a long and deeply embedded tradition of upholding vital public health regulations.	nyt
G01040	Today, however, the tradition of salus populi is in collapse.	in favor of	In state and federal courts alike, Republican-appointed and Republican-elected judges are upsetting the long-established consensus.	nyt
G01041	The health care of millions could be cast into question even as the pandemic rages.	in favor of	Next month, the court is scheduled to hear arguments on a startling and widely criticized decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas last year that offers yet another opportunity to strike down the Affordable Care Act.	nyt
G01042	All of this is a sharp departure from a long history of judicial solicitude toward state powers during epidemics.	in favor of	In the past, when epidemics have threatened white Americans and those with political clout, courts found ways to uphold broad state powers.	nyt
G01043	“It’s a reasonable bet, but still a gamble that protection for two or three months is similar to six months or a year,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the Food and Drug Administration panel that is likely to review the vaccine for approval in December.	in favor of	Normally, vaccines aren’t licensed until they show they can protect for a year or two.	nyt
G01044	scientists will have to keep an eye out for rare effects such as immune enhancement, a severe illness brought on by a virus’s interaction with immune particles in some vaccinated persons, said Dr. Walt Orenstein, a professor of medicine at Emory University and former director of the immunization program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.	against	To date, no serious side effects have been revealed, and most tend to occur within six weeks of a vaccination.	nyt
G01045	It’s possible that vaccines under development by Novavax and Sanofi, which are likely to begin late-phase clinical trials later this year, may be better for the elderly, Dr. Offit noted.	in favor of	Those vaccines contain immune-stimulating particles like the ones contained in the Shingrix vaccine, which is highly effective in protecting older people against shingles disease.	nyt
G01046	Can it be rolled out effectively?	in favor of	The Pfizer vaccine, unlike others in late-stage testing, must be kept supercooled, on dry ice around 100 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, from the time it is produced until a few days before it is injected. mRNA quickly self-destructs at higher temperatures.	nyt
G01047	Could a premature announcement hurt future vaccines?	in favor of	But if the F.D.A. approves it quickly, that could make it harder for manufacturers of other vaccines to carry out their studies.	nyt
G01048	But if the F.D.A. approves it quickly, that could make it harder for manufacturers of other vaccines to carry out their studies.	in favor of	If people are aware that an effective vaccine exists, they may decline to enter clinical trials, partly out of concern they could get a placebo and remain unprotected.	nyt
G01049	so it’s crucial to continue additional studies.	in favor of	Many vaccines will be needed in order to meet global demand for protection against Covid-19,	nyt
G01050	But it’s difficult to build such road maps.	in favor of	Scientists have never established correlates of immunity for pertussis, for example, although vaccines have been used against those bacteria for nearly a century.	nyt
G01051	Still, this is good news, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and a former F.D.A. deputy commissioner.	in favor of	He said: “I hope this makes people realize that we’re not stuck in this situation forever. There’s hope coming, whether it’s this vaccine or another.”	nyt
G01052	When hospital administrators and politicians’ spouses get immunized before people more at risk, it undermines confidence in the system.	in favor of	For weeks Americans have watched those who are well connected, wealthy or crafty “jump the line” to get a vaccine, while others are stuck, endlessly waiting on hold to get an appointment, watching sign-up websites crash or loitering outside clinics in the often-futile hope of getting a shot.	nyt
G01053	To eliminate this knock-out-your-neighbor race to score a vaccine, the administration needs to find ways to build trust in the system. It will take more than “more people, more places, more supply” to end the Darwinian competition and restore confidence and order.	in favor of	That’s in part because, desperate to end their own pandemic nightmare, many of our most respected institutions and politicians have behaved badly.	nyt
G01054	Of course hospitals have performed heroics during the pandemic —	in favor of	turning orthopedic wards into Covid intensive care units, canceling elective surgeries, bringing retired health care workers back to help, all the while losing thousands of staff members to the virus.	nyt
G01055	Of course hospitals have performed heroics during the pandemic — turning orthopedic wards into Covid intensive care units, canceling elective surgeries, bringing retired health care workers back to help, all the while losing thousands of staff members to the virus.	against	But some also have behaved selfishly during the vaccine rollout.	nyt
G01056	But some also have behaved selfishly during the vaccine rollout.	in favor of	But many hospitals interpreted the recommendation broadly, inoculating their entire staff — public relations departments, administrators, programmers, laboratory scientists and, sometimes, their boards. They offered vaccines to psychiatrists who were seeing their patients on Zoom. They vaccinated radiologists who were reading films at home.	nyt
G01057	Pity the rule-followers:	in favor of	Many older Americans who are not tech-savvy or lack internet access have been unable to get slots. It might be theoretically possible to sign up by phone, but by the time you get through, the newly released appointments may be gone. Those without a child or grandchild to help secure an appointment could be out of luck.	nyt
G01058	I don’t blame the lucky recipients;	in favor of	after all, hospitals would just offer the unused vaccine to the next person on the list.	nyt
G01059	Now, the new administration is coordinating with states to set up more mass vaccination sites. That’s great.	against	But the United States has allowed its public health system to become a hollowed-out underfunded mess, and many vaccination clinics are being run and staffed by contracted private companies. And the private sector has so far proved too vulnerable to private favoritism.	nyt
G01060	The era of the Antonine Plague offers a reminder of what a powerful force nature has been throughout human history.	in favor of	The disease revealed and amplified social tensions that had festered under the surface and brought back whispers of civil war. The people could stand no more, and even the fainthearted Senate at last showed hopeful signs of courage.	nyt
G01061	it can seem a bit uncouth to tap into our training to treat Rome as a mirror of our own times.	against	But there is a serious side to these parallels, too:	nyt
G01062	But there is a serious side to these parallels, too:	in favor of	The way we understand the past inevitably shapes how we understand the present.	nyt
G01063	What we can learn from reflecting on this chapter of ancient Rome is not so much an example to follow or neatly packaged solutions for our own crises, but a different sensibility, an awareness of what a powerful force nature has been throughout human history.	in favor of	The way we understand the past inevitably shapes how we understand the present.	nyt
G01064	The result is that even the most turned-over pages still tell us things we had not expected.	in favor of	We inevitably bring our own anxieties and sensibilities to the study of the past.	nyt
G01065	A second lesson is that human health and animal health are inseparable.	in favor of	Our relationship with the environment reverberates back upon us, sometimes with destructive force.	nyt
G01066	Living through a pandemic not only causes us to see different layers of the past, but can also inspire us to listen to our ancient sources more empathetically.	in favor of	For instance, Covid-19 has made the psychological import of daily death tolls in our ancient texts — such as the 2,000 per day that died in Rome under Commodus — far more real and vivid than ever before.	nyt
G01067	One of the hardest paradoxes to reckon with, though, is that the Antonine Plague was as much a symptom of the empire’s success as its sins or stresses.	in favor of	Rome was struck at its apex of power and prosperity — precisely because that power and prosperity had made it ecologically more likely that such a microbiological challenge would emerge and disseminate.	nyt
G01068	A sense of our fragility should not make us fatalistic. Rather, it should inspire us to be less complacent.	in favor of	Even with all the tools of modern biological science, we could not have predicted exactly when and where a new pandemic would emerge.	nyt
G01069	Even with all the tools of modern biological science, we could not have predicted exactly when and where a new pandemic would emerge.	against	But we were warned, and those warnings went unheeded, in part because we told stories about ourselves implying that we had been freed from nature, that we were immune from the patterns of the past.	nyt
G01070	It is a lesson we would do well to heed.	in favor of	The Antonine Plague wasn’t the last lethal pandemic the Romans faced. And Covid-19 won’t be ours.	nyt
G01071	vaccination passes will not end the spread of Covid-19.	in favor of	Until coronavirus vaccines are distributed equitably and nations agree to immunization standards,	nyt
G01072	Mandating vaccine passports for international travel introduces several challenges.	in favor of	International law allows countries to require visitors to prove they have been vaccinated against diseases like yellow fever. But coronavirus vaccines are new, and they haven’t all been authorized for use throughout the world.	nyt
G01073	These systems must also prevent countries from arbitrarily refusing to accept certificates.	in favor of	Without international consensus, we risk entrenching geopolitical divides with inconsistent requirements that could prolong the pandemic. Vaccine passports that enable citizens of some nations to travel internationally while millions of others wait for vaccinations will serve only to deepen global inequities.	nyt
G01074	And an American plan would present a number of issues.	in favor of	First, the vaccine rollout in the United States has been plagued by inequities: Black and Latino people are being vaccinated at much lower rates than white people. Second, not everyone can get vaccinated: The shots haven’t been approved for children, and the data on the safety of vaccinations during pregnancy is limited. Vaccination passes will need a mechanism to ensure that people who can’t get the shots aren’t denied jobs, services or education.	nyt
G01075	A requirement by employers and businesses of proof of vaccination would carry not only ethical and legal hurdles, but also logistical challenges surrounding how that data is collected, stored, verified and protected.	in favor of	Businesses that require vaccinations for customers or employees will need systems for reviewing vaccine passports, which could create a significant financial burden for struggling businesses. While schools and health care providers have long required and tracked certain immunizations, many companies have never needed to contend with vaccine requirements. If vaccine passports come in the form of a smartphone app, some people won’t be able to use them. And, of course, since a vaccine passport records private health data, a failure to protect this information would create large risk of fraud, counterfeiting, discrimination and privacy violations.	nyt
G01076	Of all the barriers to Covid-19 vaccination, fear of needles may seem trivial to overcome.	against	But millions of American adults, not to mention children, still need to be injected to keep themselves and their communities safe. And it’s likely some of them aren’t doing so in part because they fear or just don’t like needles.	nyt
G01077	This is a substantial public health problem,	in favor of	because a body of research shows that around one in 10 adults are so afraid of needles that they will delay or avoid vaccinations.	nyt
G01078	High levels of needle fear, with or without a diagnosis, can affect vaccination programs.	in favor of	Some people might avoid getting vaccinated altogether, and others might endure it under immense distress, putting them at risk for what experts call immunization stress-related responses such as feeling dizzy or fainting during an injection.	nyt
G01079	Organizers of vaccination programs have important roles to play in setting up their vaccination sites to minimize needle fears and immunization stress-related responses.	in favor of	Strategies like organizing one-way clinic flow with privacy options help avoid long lines and having people being injected “on display” for others waiting. And it doesn’t start and end at the vaccination site — people working to promote vaccines should keep needle fears in mind and consider positive and neutral images that don’t show the needles themselves.	nyt
G01080	Exposure-based therapy is recommended.	in favor of	People at the high end of the needle fear spectrum will most likely need another approach to manage that fear first rather than get a vaccination while extremely frightened.	nyt
